"Watch. Nymeria, gloves.",arya stark
Impressive.,jon snow

I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid.",jon snow
I want you to leave.,catelyn stark

"And you, Stark.",jon snow
"Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?",jon snow

Why do you read so much?,jon snow
Look at me and tell me what you see.,tyrion lannister
Is this a trick?,jon snow
"What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years.",tyrion lannister
Until your brother killed that King.,jon snow
"Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?",tyrion lannister
"Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf.",jon snow
"A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.",tyrion lannister
The Night's Watch protects the realm from...,jon snow

How old were you?,daenerys targaryen
Nine?!,daenerys targaryen
Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?,daenerys targaryen
Will it take three years?,daenerys targaryen
What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.,catelyn stark
Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.,catelyn stark
"Saw what, my lady?",theon greyjoy
I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.,catelyn stark

I don't trust a raven to carry these words.,catelyn stark

I must.,catelyn stark
Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.,catelyn stark
What about Bran?,robb stark
I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.,catelyn stark
Finish a man?,daenerys targaryen
"Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top.",daenerys targaryen
I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.,daenerys targaryen
No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.,daenerys targaryen
"Pardon me, Ser.",sansa stark
"I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?",sansa stark
"Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts.",sansa stark
Arya!,sansa stark
What are you doing here? Go away.,arya stark
He the butcher's boy.,sansa stark
He's my friend.,arya stark
Stop it!,arya stark
"Arya, stay out of this.",sansa stark
"No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!",sansa stark
Nymeria!,arya stark
"Arya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help.",sansa stark
You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go! Leave now!,arya stark
Go!,arya stark
I'm sorry.,arya stark
No.,arya stark
How dare you speak to your King in that manner?,cersei lannister
Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.,cersei lannister
That's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.,arya stark
Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.,cersei lannister
That's not what happened!,arya stark
Liar!,arya stark
"She's not. Sansa, come here, darling.",cersei lannister
I don't know. I don't remember. Everything happened so fast. I didn't see.,sansa stark
Liar! Liar liar liar!,arya stark
Liar liar liar!,arya stark
She's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished.,cersei lannister
Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.,cersei lannister
And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?,cersei lannister
We have another wolf.,cersei lannister
"He doesn't mean Lady, does he? No no, not Lady! Lady didn't bite anyone! She's good!",sansa stark
Lady wasn't there! You leave her alone!,arya stark
Stop them. Don't let them do it. Please! It wasn't Lady!,sansa stark
Where is the beast?,cersei lannister
"Ser Ilyn, do me the honor.",cersei lannister
Is this some trick?,cersei lannister
"Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership.",jaime lannister
"Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes.",jaime lannister
"I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss.",jaime lannister
"I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that.",jaime lannister
"500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice.",jaime lannister
"Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?",jaime lannister
Lord Stark.,varys
I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.,varys
"But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me.",petyr baelish
All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.,petyr baelish
"It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree.",petyr baelish
His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.,varys
We are the lords of small matters here.,petyr baelish
"Mmm, how much?",petyr baelish
"I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?",petyr baelish
I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.,petyr baelish
The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.,petyr baelish
"As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans.",petyr baelish
"You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure.",varys
"Please, it's nearly healed.",cersei lannister
"A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father.",cersei lannister
"That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it.",cersei lannister
"Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl.",cersei lannister
"No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road.",cersei lannister
How would you handle them?,cersei lannister
A royal army?,cersei lannister
And if the northerners rebel?,cersei lannister
"And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?",cersei lannister
"But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers.",cersei lannister
"The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies.",cersei lannister
Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.,cersei lannister
I'm practicing.,arya stark
Practicing for what?,sansa stark
The Prince.,arya stark
He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.,arya stark
The Hound killed your friend.,sansa stark
The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.,arya stark
You're an idiot.,sansa stark
"You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive.",arya stark
I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?,sansa stark
Go away!,arya stark
Mine.,arya stark
I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.,arya stark
It's called Needle.,arya stark
Stick 'em with the pointy end.,arya stark
I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.,arya stark
"I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa.",arya stark
So was I! He is a liar.,arya stark
But how you can let her marry someone like that?,arya stark
Winter is coming.,arya stark
I don't hate her. Not really.,arya stark
I can keep it?,arya stark
What are you telling him now?,robb stark
Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber.,robb stark
"How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall.",robb stark
Don't ever say that.,robb stark
It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.,catelyn stark
I would. We've done nothing wrong.,catelyn stark
"Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but...",catelyn stark
Cat! Go on. Go upstairs.,petyr baelish
You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a…,catelyn stark
I meant no disrespect to you of all people.,petyr baelish
How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?,catelyn stark
No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.,petyr baelish
How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?,catelyn stark
A dear friend told me.,petyr baelish
Lady Stark.,varys
Lord Varys.,catelyn stark
To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.,varys
How did you know I was coming?,catelyn stark
"Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel.",varys
Do you know whose dagger this is?,catelyn stark
I must admit I do not.,varys
"Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine.",petyr baelish
Yours?,catelyn stark
"At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger.",petyr baelish
To whom?,catelyn stark
Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.,petyr baelish
A charming man.,tyrion lannister
"And how's that going, Commander Mormont?",tyrion lannister
Good news or bad?,tyrion lannister
Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?,petyr baelish
Is she?,petyr baelish
I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.,petyr baelish
Ned! [poking her head out of a window],catelyn stark
"The Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds.",petyr baelish
It's an improvement.,jon snow
I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.,tyrion lannister
"It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it.",tyrion lannister
Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.,jon snow
Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice,tyrion lannister
They hate me because I'm better than they are.,jon snow
It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.,tyrion lannister
The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.,petyr baelish
We have proof. We have the blade.,catelyn stark
"Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf.",petyr baelish
Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.,catelyn stark
"I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything.",petyr baelish
I won't forget this. You're a true friend.,catelyn stark
Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.,petyr baelish
How could you be so stupid?,cersei lannister
Calm down.,jaime lannister
He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?,cersei lannister
I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?,jaime lannister
Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.,cersei lannister
Then what are you raving about?,jaime lannister
What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...,cersei lannister
We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.,jaime lannister
And my husband?,cersei lannister
I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us,jaime lannister
Let me go.,cersei lannister
Never.,jaime lannister
"The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world.",jaime lannister
I wish I could see the girls.,catelyn stark
Just for a moment.,catelyn stark
"I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it.",catelyn stark
And if you find the proof?,cersei lannister
"My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday.",catelyn stark
Does he?,catelyn stark
One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.,jaime lannister
You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.,jaime lannister
"I cut his head off, so no.",jaime lannister
"He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... ""Burn them all."" If that's all, your Grace...",jaime lannister
The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.,jorah mormont
From whom?,daenerys targaryen
"If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices",jorah mormont
Tell them all to stop.,daenerys targaryen
You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?,jorah mormont
Until I command them otherwise.,daenerys targaryen
You're learning to talk like a Queen.,jorah mormont
Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.,daenerys targaryen
No!,daenerys targaryen
"Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed.",daenerys targaryen
"Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?",jorah mormont
You're leaving?,jon snow
What kind of reports?,jon snow
m ready. I won't let you down.,jon snow
But I'm better than every...,jon snow
You're joking?,tyrion lannister
And how do a bear's balls taste?,tyrion lannister
"Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?",tyrion lannister
They have a better chance finding feed than glory.,tyrion lannister
"You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny.",tyrion lannister
"Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?",tyrion lannister
I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.,tyrion lannister
"But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it.",tyrion lannister
"I think he's starting to like me. ""Going below""?",tyrion lannister
So you're heading down to King's Landing too.,tyrion lannister
Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.,tyrion lannister
Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.,tyrion lannister
What are you doing?,daenerys targaryen
"For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate.",jorah mormont
Armor.,jorah mormont
Slow.,jorah mormont
"It's true, but it also keeps a man alive.",jorah mormont
I've heard that your father was a famous warrior.,jorah mormont
He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.,jorah mormont
I don't think she wants to eat dog.,jorah mormont
I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.,jorah mormont
Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.,jorah mormont
Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.,jon snow
"Eight... no, nine.",tyrion lannister
"They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon.",tyrion lannister
"Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids.",tyrion lannister
It's a boy.,daenerys targaryen
I know.,daenerys targaryen
"I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister.",jon snow
It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.,tyrion lannister
Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?,jon snow
I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.,tyrion lannister
"If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could.",jon snow
Of course.,tyrion lannister
He'll never walk again.,jon snow
"If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow.",tyrion lannister
"Farewell, My Lord.",jon snow
Who are you?,arya stark
It's too heavy.,arya stark
What if I drop it?,arya stark
I'm a girl.,arya stark
A needle.,arya stark
We have visitors.,theon greyjoy
"Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting.",theon greyjoy
"Neither do I. But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say. Hodor! Help Bran down the hall.",theon greyjoy
I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.,tyrion lannister
Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.,robb stark
"Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?",tyrion lannister
"I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away.",robb stark
Then you might learn a lordo s courtesy.,tyrion lannister
So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?,tyrion lannister
Curious.,tyrion lannister
Why are you here?,robb stark
Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.,tyrion lannister
"Do you like to ride, Bran?",tyrion lannister
"What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride.",tyrion lannister
Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.,tyrion lannister
You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.,tyrion lannister
Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?,robb stark
"I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things.",tyrion lannister
You've done my brother a kindness. The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.,robb stark
"Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier.",tyrion lannister
"Couldn't resist some northern ass? If you like redheads, ask for Ros.",theon greyjoy
"Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters.",tyrion lannister
He's not my master.,theon greyjoy
"No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?",tyrion lannister
She wasn't feeling well.,theon greyjoy
"She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?",tyrion lannister
My lady's whereabouts...,theon greyjoy
"My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?",tyrion lannister
Must have been a pretty sight.,theon greyjoy
"Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out.",tyrion lannister
We were outnumbered 10 to one.,theon greyjoy
"A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire.",tyrion lannister
"Careful, Imp.",theon greyjoy
"I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out.",tyrion lannister
"Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it.",jon snow
Enough! He yielded.,jon snow
Are you sure you want to do this?,jon snow
I've had worse.,jon snow
"It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself.",jon snow
The Wall's no place for cowards.,jon snow
Vaes Dothrak. The city of the horselords.,jorah mormont
These are my people now. You shouldn't call them savages.,daenerys targaryen
"If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?",daenerys targaryen
The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea. They fear any water their horses can't drink.,jorah mormont
But if they did?,daenerys targaryen
"King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different.",jorah mormont
And you know these men?,daenerys targaryen
"I fought beside them once, long ago. Now Ned Stark wants my head. He drove me from my land.",jorah mormont
You sold slaves.,daenerys targaryen
Aye.,jorah mormont
Why?,daenerys targaryen
I had no money and an expensive wife.,jorah mormont
And where is she now?,daenerys targaryen
"In another place, with another man.",jorah mormont
What if I have a girl?,sansa stark
What if I only have girls?,sansa stark
"Jeyne Poole's mother had five children, all of them girls.",sansa stark
But what if?,sansa stark
And everyone would hate me.,sansa stark
Joffrey does.,sansa stark
Please shut up about it.,sansa stark
Aegon the Conqueror.,sansa stark
Maegor the Cruel.,sansa stark
"My grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren't they?",sansa stark
The Mad King.,sansa stark
Why were they killed?,sansa stark
"I don't want to speak to my father, ever.",sansa stark
"No, I won't.",sansa stark
Dreadful.,varys
I will?,petyr baelish
"The realm prospers from such events, my Lord. They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes.",varys
And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged.,petyr baelish
Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.,arya stark
Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.,arya stark
He says every swordsman should study cats. They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. You have to be quick to catch them.,arya stark
Now that Bran's awake will he come live with us?,arya stark
"He wants to be a knight of the King's Guard. He can't be one now, can he?",arya stark
Can I be Lord of a holdfast?,arya stark
No. That's not me.,arya stark
Come stand by the fire. It's warmer.,jon snow
You're not. You're freezing.,jon snow
"You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam?",jon snow
"Yes, he is.",jon snow
Well… You can't get any worse.,jon snow
I hear you're reading a boring book.,petyr baelish
"He never stops. Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squire... Jon Arryn's squire. He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death.",petyr baelish
I promised Cat that I'd help you.,petyr baelish
A singularly bad idea. Do you see that boy there? One of Varys's little birds. The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there. That one belongs to the Queen. And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?,petyr baelish
No. She's one of mine. Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?,petyr baelish
"The wiser answer was no, my Lord. Get a message to this paragon of yours... Discreetly. Send him to question Ser Hugh. After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city. He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel.",petyr baelish
"I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death.",petyr baelish
Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.,petyr baelish
Listen. Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Guess.,jaime lannister
He likes to do this when I'm on duty... He makes me listen as he insults my sister.,jaime lannister
Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?,jaime lannister
"Have we? Strange, I've forgotten.",jaime lannister
That's where you got your scar?,jaime lannister
Vicious sons of whores.,jaime lannister
They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. D'you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?,jaime lannister
I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.,jaime lannister
I doubt it.,jaime lannister
I don't serve Lord Stark.,jaime lannister
Watch duty. With Sam.,jon snow
He wasn't hungry.,jon snow
"That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him.",jon snow
No one touches Sam.,jon snow
"Hush now. It's all right. Irri, take her and leave us.",daenerys targaryen
Why did you hit her?!,daenerys targaryen
I wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper.,daenerys targaryen
It's a gift. I had it made for you.,daenerys targaryen
Please.,daenerys targaryen
Stop - stop it.,daenerys targaryen
You've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet.,daenerys targaryen
I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.,daenerys targaryen
I wouldn't doubt it.,jon snow
Sally on the side?,jon snow
I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.,jon snow
"As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you.",jon snow
"I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but...",jon snow
I know where to put it.,jon snow
Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.,jon snow
Red.,jon snow
You don't want to know.,jon snow
Better.,jon snow
What's my name?,jon snow
And why is my surname Snow?,jon snow
"I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child.",jon snow
I build my own fires.,jon snow
I hit him. I hit the dragon.,daenerys targaryen
Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.,jorah mormont
He is still the true King.,daenerys targaryen
The truth now,jorah mormont
No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.,daenerys targaryen
"The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They don't care what games the high Lords play.",jorah mormont
"What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?",daenerys targaryen
Home.,jorah mormont
I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home.,daenerys targaryen
Lover's quarrel?,petyr baelish
I'm sorry. Do I...?,sansa stark
An old friend of the family. I've known your mother a long long time.,petyr baelish
Why do they call you Littlefinger?,arya stark
Arya!,sansa stark
"No, it's quite all right. When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname.",petyr baelish
"Gods, who is that?",sansa stark
Ser Gregor Clegane. They call him the Mountain. The Houndo s older brother.,petyr baelish
And his opponent?,sansa stark
Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.,petyr baelish
"Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story.",petyr baelish
I won't tell anyone. I promise.,sansa stark
"No, please don't. If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you.",petyr baelish
You're missing your tournament.,cersei lannister
I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us – the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?,cersei lannister
"The only Stark who does. Favors her mother, not much of the north in her.",cersei lannister
I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?,cersei lannister
"You can't change him. You can't help him. He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done. You'll try your best to pick up the pieces.",cersei lannister
"You're just a soldier, aren't you? You take your orders and you carry on. I suppose it makes sense. Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow.",cersei lannister
As was I.,cersei lannister
And to you.,catelyn stark
"My men can sleep in the stable. As for myself, I don't require a large room.",tyrion lannister
Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this?,tyrion lannister
You can have my room.,bronn
"There's a clever man. You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me.",tyrion lannister
Nothing would more likely ruin my supper. Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure. I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.,tyrion lannister
"I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here. You, Ser... Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?",catelyn stark
And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father... Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?,catelyn stark
The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun. My father counts Jonas Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.,catelyn stark
"I envy your father all his fine friends, but I don't quite see the purpose of this.",tyrion lannister
Knight of House Frey,catelyn stark
"This man... Came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of 10. In the name of King Robert and the good Lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king's justice.",catelyn stark
At her dancing lessons. The Knight of the Flowers.,sansa stark
"Thank you, Ser Loras.",sansa stark
Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.,sansa stark
I can't watch.,sansa stark
100 gold dragons on the Mountain.,petyr baelish
Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?,petyr baelish
He's going to die.,sansa stark
"And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?",petyr baelish
"Loras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really.",petyr baelish
Ser Loras would never do that! There's no honor in tricks.,sansa stark
No honor but quite a bit of gold.,petyr baelish
Remove his hood.,catelyn stark
This isn't the Kingsroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell.,tyrion lannister
I did... often and loudly.,catelyn stark
"Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Wordo s probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?",tyrion lannister
And why would I do that?,catelyn stark
Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.,tyrion lannister
Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.,catelyn stark
"Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?",tyrion lannister
Five years ago.,catelyn stark
"She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here.",tyrion lannister
"I am not a murderer, Lannister.",catelyn stark
Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!,tyrion lannister
The dagger found,catelyn stark
What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?,tyrion lannister
Why? Am I starting to make sense?,tyrion lannister
"Untie me. If I die, what's the point?",tyrion lannister
Rodrik?,catelyn stark
Your first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight.,bronn
"Well, I'm willing if she is.",tyrion lannister
"Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking.",theon greyjoy
Shh... Keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.,theon greyjoy
Important enough for the likes of you.,theon greyjoy
Who? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman.,theon greyjoy
Why should I be jealous?,theon greyjoy
Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.,theon greyjoy
Hmm?,theon greyjoy
Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.,theon greyjoy
"I'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters.",theon greyjoy
I've been Lord Stark's ward since I was eight years old.,theon greyjoy
My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.,theon greyjoy
I'm not a boy.,theon greyjoy
I don't want to pay for it.,theon greyjoy
Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.,arya stark
"How is your son, my Lord?",varys
But his mind is sound?,varys
A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?,varys
"If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him.",varys
I didn't trust you.,varys
"The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem.",varys
"The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace.",varys
"Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn.",varys
"Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely.",varys
Someone who could afford it.,varys
He started asking questions.,varys
He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.,varys
"The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend.",varys
This Hand is not the other.,varys
"Delay,"" you say. ""Move fast, "" I reply. This is no longer a game for two players.",varys
The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.,varys
You do move quietly.,petyr baelish
We all have our qualities.,varys
You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.,petyr baelish
I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.,varys
"Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations.",petyr baelish
"Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear.",varys
"I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important.",petyr baelish
"Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?",varys
All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.,petyr baelish
And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.,varys
"Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws.",petyr baelish
Strictly speaking.,varys
"Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered.",petyr baelish
"Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?",varys
Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?,petyr baelish
"Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King.",varys
Saw me with your own eyes?,petyr baelish
Eyes I own.,varys
Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.,petyr baelish
Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen...,varys
One shudders at the thought.,petyr baelish
Oh.,varys
But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.,petyr baelish
Have you?,varys
"Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers.",petyr baelish
Was that you under the bed?,varys
"And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friendo s sympathies… To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm.",petyr baelish
"Oh, please.",varys
To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King --,petyr baelish
To a small council meeting?,petyr baelish
Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?,varys
I'm not a beggar. I live here.,arya stark
I want to see my father.,arya stark
"My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?",arya stark
They said they were going to kill you.,arya stark
"I didn't see them, but I think one was fat.",arya stark
I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage.,arya stark

Chasing a cat.,arya stark
I'm a girl!,arya stark
How many guards does my father have?,arya stark

To whom do I speak?,catelyn stark

That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.,catelyn stark
My sister will decide what he looks like.,catelyn stark
The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.,tyrion lannister
Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch.,bronn
I like you.,tyrion lannister
"No rumor, my Lord. The princess is with child.",varys
Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.,varys
"Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man.",petyr baelish
"I understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed.",varys
"When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it.",petyr baelish
"His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word ""treason"" was mentioned.",petyr baelish
When do you return to Winterfell?,petyr baelish
"If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you.",petyr baelish
It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.,petyr baelish
"Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t-",catelyn stark
Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.,tyrion lannister
"If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do.",tyrion lannister
This man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed.,catelyn stark
I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.,cersei lannister
"Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces.",cersei lannister
No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?,cersei lannister
The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons.,cersei lannister
Is my father wrong?,cersei lannister
We still outnumber them.,cersei lannister
Five.,cersei lannister
What do you want?,cersei lannister
Our marriage.,cersei lannister
Every day.,cersei lannister
"Well, seventeen years is quite a long time.",cersei lannister
"Yes, it tis. What was she like?",cersei lannister
"At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it.",cersei lannister
What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?,cersei lannister
"I felt something for you once, you know?",cersei lannister
"Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a... moment?",cersei lannister
It doesn't make me feel anything.,cersei lannister
"Brothels make a much better investment than ship, I've found. Whores rarely sink.",petyr baelish
"Well, he has more than you, for a start.",petyr baelish
"Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents.",petyr baelish
He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.,petyr baelish
Such a small pack of wolves.,jaime lannister
Was!... the Hand of the King. Now I'm not sure what he is... Lord of somewhere very far away.,jaime lannister
"What's the meaning of this, Lannister?",petyr baelish
"Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man.",jaime lannister
"It seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?",jaime lannister
My Lords! I'll bring the City Watch!,petyr baelish
"Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand.",jaime lannister
"Threaten? As in, ""I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of”?",jaime lannister
You're right. Take him alive! Kill his men!,jaime lannister
"My brother, Lord Stark... We want him back.",jaime lannister
Do you know what your wife has done?,cersei lannister
By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?,cersei lannister
You were the King's Hand!,cersei lannister
You shall now be held accountable.,cersei lannister
Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.,cersei lannister
I took you for a king.,cersei lannister
He's attacked my brother and abducted the other. I should wear the armor and you the gown.,cersei lannister
I shall wear this like a badge of honor.,cersei lannister
You're hurt.,daenerys targaryen
Not too fast.,robb stark
When are you gonna tell him?,theon greyjoy
Not now.,robb stark
Blood for blood. You need to make the Lannisters to pay for Jory and the others.,theon greyjoy
You're talking about war.,robb stark
I'm talking about justice.,theon greyjoy
Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army.,robb stark
A Lannister put his spear through your father's leg. The Kingslayer rides to Casterly Rock where no one can touch -,theon greyjoy
You want me to march on Casterly Rock?!,robb stark
You're not a boy anymore. They attacked your father. They've already started the war. It's your duty to represent your House when your father can't.,theon greyjoy

Where's Bran?,robb stark
I don't know. It's not my House.,theon greyjoy
Drop the knife. Let him go and I'll let you live.,robb stark
Are you all right?,robb stark
"Tough little lad. In the Iron Islands, you're not a man until you've killed your first enemy. Well done.",theon greyjoy
Have you lost your mind? What if you'd missed?,robb stark
He would have killed you and cut Bran's throat.,theon greyjoy
You don't have the right -,robb stark

About the gold -,tyrion lannister
"Listen to me! Listen to me! Sometimes possession… is an abstract concept. When they captured me they took my purse, but the gold is still mine.",tyrion lannister
"Where? I don't know where, but when they free me -",tyrion lannister
"Have you ever heard the phrase “Rich as a Lannister”? Of course you have. You're a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, “a Lannister always pays his debts.” If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do.",tyrion lannister
Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.,tyrion lannister
"Yes, my lady. I do, my lady.",tyrion lannister
"Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I'm a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and… I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -",tyrion lannister
Confessing my crimes.,tyrion lannister
"Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister's husband; Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.",catelyn stark
"Oh, I'm very sorry. I don't know anything about all that.",tyrion lannister
"Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King's Justice? I'm accused and demand a trial.",tyrion lannister
I understand the law.,tyrion lannister
No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat.,tyrion lannister
Agreed.,tyrion lannister
"Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you.",tyrion lannister
"I wouldn't be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister.",tyrion lannister

I'll stand for the dwarf.,bronn
Fish. The sigil of House Tully. Isn't that your wife's House - Tully - my Lord Hand?,petyr baelish
That sounds like someone we know. The Mountain.,petyr baelish
I've heard him called “Tywin Lannister's mad dog.” I'm sure you have as well. Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?,petyr baelish
It would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.,petyr baelish
"A bold move, my Lord, and admirable. But is it wise to yank the lion's tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. Gold wins wars, not soldiers.",petyr baelish
No. He did.,bronn
Not this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine.,tyrion lannister
A Lannister always pays his debts.,tyrion lannister

My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.,cersei lannister
The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure.,cersei lannister

"l want you to serve the realm! Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Cersei knows you as a man of honor. lf you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son.",varys
"Pity. Such a pity. What of your daughter's life, my lord? ls that a precious thing to you?",varys
lt's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda.,robb stark
Or so Walder Frey would have you think.,theon greyjoy
Keep shooting them down. We can't risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.,catelyn stark
He's Grandfather's bannerman. We can't expect his support?,robb stark
Father rots in a dungeon. How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.,robb stark
Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing. We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.,theon greyjoy
"The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll.",catelyn stark
Have my horse saddled and ready.,robb stark
Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.,theon greyjoy
"My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing. Whatever it took. lf l'm going to lead this army, l can't have other men doing my bargaining for me.",robb stark
l agree. l'll go.,catelyn stark
l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl. He would never harm me.,catelyn stark
"lt is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord.",catelyn stark
ls there somewhere we can talk?,catelyn stark
l'm sure she will give you many sons.,catelyn stark
"He is quite ill, my lord.",catelyn stark
"My lord, l –",catelyn stark
l'm sure there were reasons –,catelyn stark
"To ask you to open your gates, my lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way.",catelyn stark
"lf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls.",catelyn stark
You swore an oath to my father.,catelyn stark
Why don't you?,catelyn stark
"Soon, he says.",jon snow
This is Valyrian steel.,jon snow
"My lord, you honor me, but l can't –",jon snow
"Yes, my lord.",jon snow
l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.,jon snow
At what?,jon snow
What is it?,jon snow
You can't what?,jon snow
And yet you really want to say. You want to say that…,jon snow
What? What about him?,jon snow
l should be there. l should be with him.,jon snow
Well? What did he say?,robb stark
"Lord Walder has granted your crossing. His men are yours, as well.",catelyn stark
Huh.,robb stark
Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.,catelyn stark
What does he want in return?,robb stark
You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.,catelyn stark
"Fine, fine. And?",robb stark
And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.,catelyn stark
She won't be happy about that. And?,robb stark
And when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters. Whichever you prefer. He has a number he thinks will be suitable.,catelyn stark
l see. Did you get a look at his daughters?,robb stark
l did.,catelyn stark
And?,robb stark
One was – Do you consent?,catelyn stark
Can l refuse?,robb stark
Not if you want to cross.,catelyn stark
Then l consent.,robb stark
Sam said you wanted to see me?,jon snow
No.,jon snow
"He would do whatever was right, no matter what.",jon snow
Sam told you.,jon snow
And this is my day? ls that what you're saying?,jon snow
"You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother.",jon snow
Who are you?,jon snow
You're Aemon Targaryen.,jon snow
My lord… My sun and stars… Drogo.,daenerys targaryen
"He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest. We've ridden far enough today. We'll camp here.",daenerys targaryen
We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.,daenerys targaryen
Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me.,daenerys targaryen
Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.,daenerys targaryen
"The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage.",tywin lannister
"Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt.",tyrion lannister
"l do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them.",tywin lannister
Shagga likes axes.,tyrion lannister
"When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard.",tywin lannister
The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?,tyrion lannister
"Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay.",tyrion lannister
"When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander.",tywin lannister
Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.,tyrion lannister
There'll be no more discussion on the matter.,tywin lannister
"lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords.",tyrion lannister
Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?,tyrion lannister
l took her.,bronn
Took her? From whom?,tyrion lannister
"From, uh, Ser What's-his-name? l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down.",bronn
And he didn't have anything to say about it?,tyrion lannister
He said something.,bronn
"Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow.",tyrion lannister
"Oh, well. l, uh, think l'll go and find myself one.",bronn
Who are you?,tyrion lannister
What did your mother call you?,tyrion lannister
My mother died giving birth to me.,tyrion lannister
What sort of accent is that?,tyrion lannister
For-,tyrion lannister
"What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent. l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be.",tyrion lannister
"One - safety. No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. Two - the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular.",tyrion lannister
And three - more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. Do you accept my proposal?,tyrion lannister
Khaleesi.,jorah mormont
Come. He's very strong. No one understands how strong he is.,daenerys targaryen
"He will die tonight, Khaleesi.",jorah mormont
He can't. He can't. l won't let him.,daenerys targaryen
Even a queen doesn't have that power. We must go quickly. l've heard there's a good port in Asshai.,jorah mormont
l won't leave him.,daenerys targaryen
"He's already gone, Khaleesi.",jorah mormont
"Even if he dies, why would l run? l am khaleesi, and my my son will be khal after Drogo.",daenerys targaryen
"This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs.",jorah mormont
Stop it! l don't want her hurt.,daenerys targaryen
Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.,jorah mormont
l have never been nothing. l am the blood of the dragon.,daenerys targaryen
"l think you should wear your armor tonight, ser.",daenerys targaryen
l think you're right.,jorah mormont
And now you must save him.,daenerys targaryen
Save him and l will free you. l swear it. You must know a way. Some – some magic.,daenerys targaryen
Do it. Save him.,daenerys targaryen
"You'll have gold, whatever you want.",daenerys targaryen
My death?,daenerys targaryen
Kill her and you kill your khal.,daenerys targaryen
l am your khaleesi. l tell you what is forbidden.,daenerys targaryen
Take her and leave. Take her!,daenerys targaryen
No one will enter.,daenerys targaryen
Bring him back to me.,daenerys targaryen
l have to save him.,daenerys targaryen
This must be.,daenerys targaryen
"No, you can't.",daenerys targaryen
"No further, horselord.",jorah mormont
Are you hurt?,jorah mormont
The baby –,daenerys targaryen
Hmm?,jorah mormont

Fetch the midwives.,jorah mormont
They'll come or l'll have their heads.,jorah mormont
No.,tyrion lannister
"Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?",tyrion lannister
Drink.,bronn
Let's play a new game.,tyrion lannister
There's a Braavosi knife game l could teach you.,bronn
Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?,tyrion lannister
Not if you win.,bronn
"No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at.",tyrion lannister
l happen to be a great judge of character.,tyrion lannister
This sounds like a boring game.,bronn
"lt's not. Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past. lf l'm right, you drink. lf l'm wrong, l drink. And no lying. l'll know if you're lying.",tyrion lannister
Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.,tyrion lannister
But my mother hit harder.,bronn
You killed your first man before you were 12.,tyrion lannister
lt was a woman. She swung an axe at me.,bronn
You've been north of the Wall.,tyrion lannister
Work.,bronn
"And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty.",tyrion lannister
lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.,tyrion lannister
"All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return.",tyrion lannister
And we've established the rules about lying?,tyrion lannister
You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.,tyrion lannister
The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.,bronn
"So, specifics… You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?",tyrion lannister
Are you sure –,tyrion lannister
"My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize.",tyrion lannister
"Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me.",tyrion lannister
That's not how the game works.,tyrion lannister
Our lord here used to be married.,bronn
How did you hear that?,tyrion lannister
You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.,bronn
"Another night, perhaps.",tyrion lannister
lt's not a pleasant story.,tyrion lannister
l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.,bronn
"So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed.",tyrion lannister
"For three chickens, l should hope so.",bronn
"lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father.",tyrion lannister
"Well, l imagine that was the end of all that.",bronn
"Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor.",tyrion lannister
l would have killed the man who did that to me.,bronn
"Really? l was 16, drunk and in love.",tyrion lannister
"As l said, l was young and stupid.",tyrion lannister
What is it? What do you want?,tyrion lannister
You're sleeping through the war.,bronn
What?,tyrion lannister
They stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north.,bronn
Get my squire!,tyrion lannister
You don't have a squire.,bronn
"lf l die, weep for me.",tyrion lannister
l'll know.,tyrion lannister
Stay low.,bronn
Stay low?,tyrion lannister
"lf you're lucky, no one will notice you.",bronn
"l was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours!",tyrion lannister
To battle!,tyrion lannister
You're a shit warrior.,bronn
l'm alive?,tyrion lannister
You're alive.,bronn
Did we win?,tyrion lannister
We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.,bronn
How did our tribesmen do?,tyrion lannister
"Yeah, good.",bronn
lt's nice to see them getting along.,tyrion lannister
You're wounded.,tywin lannister
Good of you to notice. l hear we won.,tyrion lannister
"Huh! The scouts were wrong. There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20 [thousand].",tywin lannister
"Did we get the Stark boy, at least?",tyrion lannister
He wasn't here.,tywin lannister
Where was he?,tyrion lannister
"With his other 18,000 men.",tywin lannister
And where are they?,tyrion lannister
No!,catelyn stark
"By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened.",robb stark
"Lady Stark. l'd offer you my sword, but l seem to have lost it.",jaime lannister
lt is not your sword l want. Give me my daughters back. Give me my husband.,catelyn stark
"l've lost them too, l'm afraid.",jaime lannister
"Kill him, Robb. Send his head to his father. He cut down ten of our men. You saw him.",theon greyjoy
He's more use to us alive than dead.,robb stark
Take him away and put him in irons.,catelyn stark
"We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives. You fight for the Starks, l fight for the Lannisters. Swords or lances, teeth, nails - choose your weapons and let's end this here and now.",jaime lannister
"lf we do it your way, Kingslayer, you'd win. We're not doing it your way.",robb stark
"l sent 2,000 men to their graves today.",robb stark
The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.,theon greyjoy
Aye. But the dead won't hear them. One victory does not make us conquerors. Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over.,robb stark
Could l have one? A lemon one or any of them.,arya stark
How about a nice fat pigeon?,arya stark
Do you have any stale ones from yesterday? Or any burnt ones?,arya stark
"Hey, where's everyone going? What's happening?",arya stark
Who?,arya stark
"No, stop! Please, someone stop him!",sansa stark
"My son, this is madness.",cersei lannister
Let me go.,arya stark
"Stop him, stop!",sansa stark
l'm not a boy!,arya stark
Robb. Robb! You've ruined your sword.,catelyn stark
Shh! Shh! Shh!,catelyn stark
l'll kill them all. Every one of them. l will kill them all.,robb stark
My boy. They have your sisters. We have to get the girls back. And then we will kill them all.,catelyn stark
"Thank you, my lord.",sansa stark
"No! Please, no!",sansa stark
You promised to be merciful.,sansa stark
"Please let me go home. l won't do any treason, l swear –",sansa stark
How long do l have to look?,sansa stark
lf it please Your Grace.,sansa stark
Or maybe he'll give me yours.,sansa stark
Renly is not the king.,robb stark
"That doesn't make Renly king. He's Robert's youngest brother. lf Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me, Renly can't be king before Stannis.",robb stark
"Am l your brother, now and always?",theon greyjoy
Now and always.,robb stark
"My sword is yours in victory and defeat, from this day until my last day.",theon greyjoy
l want to see him. Now! Leave us.,catelyn stark
Leave us.,catelyn stark
"You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark. Widowhood becomes you. Your bed must be lonely. ls that why you came? l'm not at my best, but l think l could be of service. You slip out of that gown and we'll see if l'm up to it. Oh, l do like a violent woman.",jaime lannister
"l will kill you tonight, Ser. Pack your head in a box and send it to your sister.",catelyn stark
"Let me show you how. Hit me again, over the ear. And again and again. You're stronger than you look, it shouldn't take long.",jaime lannister
"That is what you want the world to believe, isn't it? That you don't fear death.",catelyn stark
"But l don't, my lady. The dark is coming for all of us. Why cry about it?",jaime lannister
"Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells, if the gods are just.",catelyn stark
What gods are those? The trees your husband prayed to? Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off? lf your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice?,jaime lannister
Because of men like you.,catelyn stark
There are no men like me. Only me.,jaime lannister
My son Bran. How did he come to fall from that tower?,catelyn stark
l pushed him out the window.,jaime lannister
Why?,catelyn stark
I hoped the fall would kill him.,jaime lannister
You should get some sleep. lt's going to be a long war.,jaime lannister
Stop talking. Get back into bed.,cersei lannister
They have my son.,tywin lannister
The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped.,tyrion lannister
There's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning – in case you hadn't noticed.,tyrion lannister
"They have my son! Get out, all of you. Not you. You were right about Eddard Stark. lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now – madness. Madness and stupidity. l always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps l was wrong.",tywin lannister
"Half wrong. l'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here.",tyrion lannister
No one will stay here. Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from Godo s Eye to the Red Fork. The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. And you will go to King's Landing.,tywin lannister
And do what?,tyrion lannister
"Rule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest – Baelish, Varys, Pycelle…",tywin lannister
"Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?",tyrion lannister
"You're my son. Oh, one more thing. You will not take that whore to court. Do you understand?",tywin lannister

They say the child was –,jorah mormont
Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me. Show me what l bought with my son's life.,daenerys targaryen
Time enough for that later –,jorah mormont

The khalasar is gone.,daenerys targaryen
"A khal who cannot ride is no khal. The Dothraki follow only the strong. l'm sorry, my Princess.",jorah mormont
Drogo! My sun and stars. Why is he out here alone?,daenerys targaryen
"He seems to like the warmth, Princess.",jorah mormont
This is not life. When will he be as he was?,daenerys targaryen
Leave us.,daenerys targaryen

"My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says.

A man with great ambition and no morals… l wouldn't bet against you.,varys

You must be one of the few men in the city who isn't a man.,petyr baelish
"Oh, you can do better than that.",varys
"When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones? l've always wondered.",petyr baelish

"l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all.",varys
"Must be strange for you, even after all these years… a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all.",petyr baelish
Am l? That is good to know. Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?,varys
But you carry on whispering in one king's ear and then the next. l admire you.,petyr baelish
"And l admire you, Lord Baelish. A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men – and women.",varys
"A useful talent, l'm sure you'd agree.",petyr baelish

Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.,tyrion lannister
Robb Stark is a child.,cersei lannister
Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war?,tyrion lannister
What do you know about warfare?,cersei lannister
Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.,tyrion lannister
Joffrey is King.,cersei lannister
Joffrey is King.,tyrion lannister
You are here to advise him.,cersei lannister
"I'm only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back.",tyrion lannister
How?,cersei lannister
You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them.,tyrion lannister
One.,cersei lannister
One?,tyrion lannister
"Arya, little animal, she disappeared.",cersei lannister
"Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child.",tyrion lannister
He said they ate meat.,daenerys targaryen
My brother didn't know anything about dragons. He didn't know anything about anything.,daenerys targaryen
She was Drogo's first gift to me.,daenerys targaryen
I remember.,jorah mormont
I promised to protect them. Promised them their enemies would die screaming. How do I make starvation scream?,daenerys targaryen
"A trick I never learned, I'm afraid.",jorah mormont
Does it ever end?,daenerys targaryen
"This is further east than I've ever been. But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the red waste.",jorah mormont
And you're sure there's no other way?,daenerys targaryen
"If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons. If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first Khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons.",jorah mormont
No one will take my dragons.,daenerys targaryen
"They are too weak to fight, as are your people. You must be their strength.",jorah mormont
As you are mine.,daenerys targaryen
"Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro. Take our remaining horses. You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast.",daenerys targaryen
"Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea. Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side.",daenerys targaryen
"Rokharo, you are my last hope, blood of my blood.",daenerys targaryen
You never have.,daenerys targaryen
Having a rough time of it?,jon snow
Nothing's killed me yet.,sam
You offered me a ride!,sam
Are those girls?,sam
I haven't seen a girl in six months.,sam
That's foul.,sam
What happens to the boys?,jon snow
Hmm?,sam
He marries his daughters. What does he do with his sons?,jon snow
We're not Southerners.,jon snow
Jon Snow.,jon snow
Lord commander.,jon snow
Your steward.,jon snow
Not now.,davos
For the night is dark and full of terror.,stannis baratheon
"Stannis is our king. We follow where he leads, even if we don't like the path.",davos
I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.,davos
What's the truth?,davos
"He wasn't my beloved brother. . I didn't love him, he didn't love me.",stannis baratheon
"A harmless courtesy, Your Grace.",davos
A lie. Take it out.,stannis baratheon
"Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Call him what he is.",stannis baratheon
"Make it Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight.",stannis baratheon
"When Eddard Stark learned the truth, he told only me. I'll not make the same mistake. Send copies of that letter to every corner of the Realm, from the Arbor to the Wall. The time has come to choose. Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse.",stannis baratheon
"Your Grace, the Lannisters are the true enemy. If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother -",davos
I'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself King.,stannis baratheon
"Well, many have already declared for him; Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly.",davos
And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?,davos
"I'm sure he doesn't, but we do if we're going to war. If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark.",davos
"Who would steal the northern half of my kingdom. I've always served thieves according to their desserts, as you well know, Ser Davos. Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves. They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them.",stannis baratheon
Don't.,davos
"King in the North. I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp. Have you grown fond of me, Stark? Is that it? I've never seen you with a girl.",jaime lannister
"If I left you with one of my bannermen, your father would know within a fortnight, and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message, ""Release my son and you'll be rich beyond your dreams. Refuse and your house will be destroyed, root and stem.”",robb stark
You don't trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle?,jaime lannister
"Oh, I trust them with my life. Just not with yours.",robb stark
Smart boy. What's wrong? Don't like being called ‘boy'? Insulted?,jaime lannister
"You insult yourself, Kingslayer. You've been defeated by a boy.",robb stark
You're held captive by a boy. Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy. . Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros. King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon. . He's your bastard son.,robb stark
"If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king. How convenient for him.",jaime lannister
My father learned the truth. That's why you had him executed.,robb stark
I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.,jaime lannister
Your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him. And you... you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen.,robb stark
You have proof? Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?,jaime lannister
I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.,robb stark
You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well.,jaime lannister
"No, but he's starting to know me.",robb stark
Three victories don't make you a conqueror.,jaime lannister
It's better than three defeats.,robb stark
"A bit corpsey, yes.",tyrion lannister
I thought you wanted to come here.,tyrion lannister
You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?,tyrion lannister
You can smell cum from the balcony?,tyrion lannister
And so did the country.,tyrion lannister
"Yes, well, you need to be careful. No one can know you're here.",tyrion lannister
"You can't trust anyone in King's Landing. They're all liars; good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars.",tyrion lannister
Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.,tyrion lannister
"Why do you think I am so little? I'm being, , crushed beneath the weight of all that truth.",tyrion lannister
"Ned Stark actually slept on this, as if the poor man didn't suffer enough. One of the many changes we'll have to make around here.",tyrion lannister
Lord Baelish.,cersei lannister
Your Grace.,petyr baelish
I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.,cersei lannister
"Of course, Your Grace.",petyr baelish
Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya... we can't seem to locate her.,cersei lannister
"If she's escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination.",petyr baelish
And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.,cersei lannister
Curious.,petyr baelish
"If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her, well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts.",cersei lannister
"Well, you could ask Varys where she is. He'll have an answer for you. Whether you believe it,,, Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs. Who knows what they want?",petyr baelish
"A mockingbird. . You created your own Sigil, didn't you?",cersei lannister
Yes.,petyr baelish
Appropriate for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.,cersei lannister
I'm glad you like it. Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family. Others have to find their own way.,petyr baelish
"I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly, she had eyes for another.",cersei lannister
"When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise. Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections. And when these affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation, indeed. Especially in a prominent family. But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I've found.",petyr baelish
And which truth is that?,cersei lannister
Knowledge is power.,petyr baelish
Seize him. . Cut his throat. . Stop. Wait. I've changed my mind. Let him go. . Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes. . Power is power. Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me. I would very much appreciate it.,cersei lannister
You're Ser Alton Lannister?,robb stark
"I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms. First, your family must release my sisters. Second, my father's bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell. And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned. Their families can honor them with proper funerals.",robb stark
"Third... Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North. From this time, till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom.",robb stark
"Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again. If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father, only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me.",robb stark
"These are my terms. If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace. If not, I will litter the south with Lannister dead.",robb stark
"Oh, is he? You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton. That will be all for tonight.",robb stark
"A word, Your Grace?",theon greyjoy
You don't have to call me ‘Your Grace' when no one's around.,robb stark
It's not so bad once you get used to it.,theon greyjoy
I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.,robb stark
"The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?",theon greyjoy
Of course they are.,robb stark
"We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing. And we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships and men who know how to sail them.",theon greyjoy
Men who fought my father.,robb stark
"Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now. I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me. I know he will. I'm not a Stark. I know that. But your father raised me to be an honorable man. We can avenge him together.",theon greyjoy
You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.,catelyn stark
I need his ships. They say he has 200.,robb stark
They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing. Shall we rally them to fight for us?,catelyn stark
I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.,robb stark
I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy. Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.,catelyn stark
"Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne. Before me, it was father. You married one rebel and mothered another.",robb stark
"I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten.",catelyn stark
"If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet.",robb stark
"You want to leave Sansa in the Queen's hands? And Arya, I haven't heard a word about Arya. What are we fighting for if not for them?",catelyn stark
It's more complicated than that! You know it is.,robb stark
It's time for me to go home. I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.,catelyn stark
You can't go to Winterfell.,robb stark
I beg your pardon?,catelyn stark
"I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys, ‘cause tomorrow, you'll ride south to the Stormlands.",robb stark
Why in the name of all the Gods -,catelyn stark
"Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon. He's rallied an army of 100,000. You know him. You know his family.",robb stark
I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy. You have a hundred other lords -,catelyn stark
"Which of these lords do I trust more than you? If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one. When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace. We'll get the girls back. Then we'll all go home for good.",robb stark
I will ride at first light.,catelyn stark
"We will all be together again soon, I promise.",robb stark
You've done so well. Your father would be proud.,catelyn stark
Give Lord Renly my regards.,robb stark
King Renly. There's a king in every corner now.,catelyn stark
What is all this?,cersei lannister
We can't find Arya Stark.,cersei lannister
"Perhaps. But if not, we need her. They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone.",cersei lannister
We need to set our armies to the task of finding her. Send out as many men as we can. I'm sure if you asked grandfather -,cersei lannister
His life is in danger.,cersei lannister
Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.,cersei lannister
Of course it is. No one believes this foul gossip -,cersei lannister
What are you asking?,cersei lannister
What are you doing here?,cersei lannister
Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as hand in his stead.,varys
You brought this on yourself.,tyrion lannister
I've done nothing.,cersei lannister
Do you understand we're losing the war?,tyrion lannister
Does it ever end?,daenerys targaryen
"Everything ends, even the red waste.",jorah mormont
"Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro.. Take our remaining horses. Find out how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side.",daenerys targaryen
What happens to the boys? What does he do with his sons?,jon snow
Send copies of that letter to every corner of the realm.,stannis baratheon
I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.,robb stark
You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well.,jaime lannister
"We won't beat them until we take King's Landing, and we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships, and men who know how to sail them.",theon greyjoy
Men who fought my father.,robb stark
I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me.,theon greyjoy
You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.,catelyn stark
I need his ships.,robb stark
He is not trustworthy!,catelyn stark
What are you asking?,cersei lannister
What do you want?,arya stark
I have friends.,arya stark
You should have asked nicely.,arya stark
They don't scare me.,arya stark
What are gold cloaks doing this far from King's Landing?,arya stark
They're looking for me.,arya stark
My lord.,varys
We were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces.,varys
It was quite a battle.,tyrion lannister
I heard you suffered a terrible head wound. The northerners are such fearsome warriors.,varys
To find so lovely creature working in your father's kitchen. It almost beggars belief.,varys
Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie.,tyrion lannister
How can you tell?,varys
Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet. .,tyrion lannister
"I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital. Friends are such an important part of life. Unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come. But rest easy my lord, I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends.",varys
"Your discretion is legendary, where your friends are concerned.",tyrion lannister
"How unspeakable of me to go on and on, when all you want to do is rest. I will leave you. . Welcome to Kings Landing, my dear. The city is made brighter by your presence. We have a council meeting, my lord.",varys
I don't like threats.,tyrion lannister
Who threatened you?,varys
I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played.,tyrion lannister
Ned Stark was a man of honor.,varys
And I am not. Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea.,tyrion lannister
"You might be disappointed in the results. The storms come and go. The big fish eat the little fish. And I keep on paddling. Come, my lord. We shouldn't keep the queen waiting.",varys
"From this time until the end of time, we are not part of your realm, but a free and independent Kingdom of the North.” . He has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that.",cersei lannister
"You've perfected the art of tearing up papers. Give him his father's bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith.",tyrion lannister
"You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?",cersei lannister
Did you see my brother when you were the Starks guest?,cersei lannister
"If you speak with him, tell him he's not been forgotten.",cersei lannister
"Safe travels, cousin.",tyrion lannister
You have a deft hand with diplomacy.,tyrion lannister
If that's everything?,cersei lannister
Trouble with the wildlings?,varys
That's why they're called wildlings.,petyr baelish
Somewhat less wild these days. It seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this King-Beyond-the-Wall.,varys
"Another king? How many is that now, Five? I've lost count.",cersei lannister
Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall.,tyrion lannister
Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare.,cersei lannister
"Cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them.",tyrion lannister
"According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers. . Mormont doesn't lie.",tyrion lannister
How do you kill a dead man?,varys
Apparently you burn him.,tyrion lannister
One trip to The Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks. .,cersei lannister
"I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you. The Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall.",tyrion lannister
I have every confidence the brave men of the Night's Watch will protect us all.,cersei lannister
"Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives. Wouldn't two, or three, be enough for him?",sam
Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away.,sam
I'm sure that's nice too.,sam
You were with her? How many times?,sam
Wish I'd grew up on a farm.,sam
"Oh, oh. Right. I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt. .",sam
What're you doing?,jon snow
"This is Gilly, she's one of Craster's daughters.",sam
"Hello, Gilly. What're you doing?",jon snow
"I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed to -",jon snow
"She's pregnant. . We have to take her with us, when we leave.",sam
What? .,jon snow
I know it sounds a bit mad.,sam
"No it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible.",jon snow
"The Lord Commander, , we are sworn to protect -",sam
Sam we can't take her -,jon snow
It's just not possible.,jon snow
"If it's a boy what? . You want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why.",jon snow
Why did you do that?,sam
"Do what, ask her a question?",jon snow
You were cruel.,sam
Cruel! Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?,jon snow
I didn't touch her!,sam
No you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that?,jon snow
"I can't steal her, she's a person not a goat.",sam
"We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?",jon snow
I could try. . What? I've read about it. A bit.,sam
"I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her.",jon snow
Khaleesi.,jorah mormont
You don't need to see this.,jorah mormont
He is blood of my blood.,daenerys targaryen
Who did this?,daenerys targaryen
"Khal Pono perhaps, Khal Jhaqo They don't like the idea of a woman leading a Khalasaar.",jorah mormont
They will like it far less when I'm done with them.,daenerys targaryen
Shh. They cannot kill his soul.,daenerys targaryen
Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre.,daenerys targaryen
"And I promise you, Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight.",daenerys targaryen
Looks smaller.,theon greyjoy
They'll be waiting for me on the docks.,theon greyjoy
"Anyone who matters, , this is a big day for them. They haven't had much to get excited about since I left. It's a hard place the Iron Islands always has been. It's cold and it's wet.",theon greyjoy
"They say hard places breed hard men, , and hard men rule the world.",theon greyjoy
"Try smiling with your lips closed. . Hmm, better.",theon greyjoy
I don't blame him.,theon greyjoy
"Quit talking about your father. He's right about us. Our wives from the Iron Islands, they're for breeding. That's not enough for us. That's why we take saltwives, from the women we capture.",theon greyjoy
Your place is on this ship.,theon greyjoy
I haven't paid you.,theon greyjoy
"One moment, my friend. A moment.",petyr baelish
Please accept my sincerest apologies. Ramka will take good care of you.,petyr baelish
Shhh. Did he hurt you?,petyr baelish
Who?,petyr baelish
"Ah, yes, that was poorly handled. Sometimes those with the most power have the least grace.",petyr baelish
"You know, you remind me of another girl. A lovely thing I once acquired from an Elysium pleasure house. Beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent as yourself. But she wasn't happy. She cried, often. I asked her why but, we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and I have. Yes, it was quite sad. Girls from Elysium pleasure houses are expensive. Extremely expensive. And this one wasn't making me any money. I hate bad investments. Really, I do. They haunt me. I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses. A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl. To use her in ways that never occur to most men. And you know what occurs to most men. I would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated. . Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen's child. I'll see you tomorrow. But you'll be happy? . That makes me happy.",petyr baelish
"Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine.",tyrion lannister
"Myself, I prefer the improper ones.",tyrion lannister
"You know your wines, my lord.",tyrion lannister
"Call me Tyrion, please. I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord.",tyrion lannister
Wars have been started for less.,tyrion lannister
I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.,tyrion lannister
"Yes, of course. City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies.",tyrion lannister
Quite right. Especially the queen's orders.,tyrion lannister
"No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman.",tyrion lannister
You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister.,tyrion lannister
"That's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children.",tyrion lannister
I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me.,tyrion lannister
The fool! He had no idea you were already bought.,tyrion lannister
"I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence.",tyrion lannister
"Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here.",tyrion lannister
"I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about.",tyrion lannister
The queen regent. And you're a fool to believe she's your friend.,tyrion lannister
"No, we shan't.",tyrion lannister
"There's a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight. From there, I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way.",tyrion lannister
"The lads will escort you. The streets aren't safe at night, my lord.",bronn
His name is Bronn... and he is the new commander of the City Watch.,tyrion lannister
Boys?,bronn
To the new Commander.,tyrion lannister
"If I told you to murder, an infant girl say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question?",tyrion lannister
Without question? No. I'd ask how much.,bronn
"If you got within a mile of a battle, you'd fill your pants.",arya stark
Liar.,arya stark
So?,arya stark
"Gendry's an armorer's apprentice. Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle.",arya stark
What do the gold cloaks want with you?,arya stark
You're a liar.,arya stark
Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone. .,arya stark
No goodo s ever come? Who asked questions before?,arya stark
Who asked questions?,arya stark
Lord Stark.,arya stark
What did they ask about?,arya stark
Who's your mom?,arya stark
And who was your father?,arya stark
I'm not a girl!,arya stark
"Stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that.",arya stark
I am not!,arya stark
I don't need to take a piss… Lommy and Hot Pie can't know. No one can know.,arya stark
My name's not Arry. It's Arya. Of House Stark. Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.,arya stark
He was never a traitor! Joffrey is a liar.,arya stark
"No. I mean yes. My mother was a lady, and my sister -",arya stark
Do not call me milady.,arya stark
Pears and oranges. Wine from the Arbor. And the heir to Pyke of the Iron Islands. . The only living son of Balon Greyjoy. . Me.,theon greyjoy
I need to get to Pyke.,theon greyjoy
I bet you can.,theon greyjoy
None like you.,theon greyjoy
You don't know what you're like. You need someone to teach you. Know who I am?,theon greyjoy
Have my things sent up to the castle.,theon greyjoy
"You should give me the reins, I'm a better rider than you. I've been on horseback for the last nine years.",theon greyjoy
Don't you worry about my hands. . The sea's in my blood.,theon greyjoy
"I have a proposal for my father. One that will make him king again. And me after him. You may stay at the castle tonight, if you're lucky.",theon greyjoy
"An order, from your future king. You can tell your grandchildren about this night.",theon greyjoy
Father.,theon greyjoy
A man. Your blood and your heir.,theon greyjoy
Lord Stark is gone.,theon greyjoy
What's done is done. I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.,theon greyjoy
"If my clothes offend you, I will change them.",theon greyjoy
Gold.,theon greyjoy
My blood is salt and iron.,theon greyjoy
"The offer he makes, is one I proposed.",theon greyjoy
"I've lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side, he thinks of me as a brother.",theon greyjoy
I forget nothing. I remember my brothers. And I remember when my father was a king.,theon greyjoy
I will lead the attack myself.,theon greyjoy
I'm your son. Your only living heir. Who else?,theon greyjoy
I told you to wait outside. . How did you get past the guards?,theon greyjoy
Yara?,theon greyjoy
She can't lead an attack!,theon greyjoy
You're a woman!,theon greyjoy
You won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own.,theon greyjoy
You'll have your gold when we take the treasury at King's Landing.,davos
"Because you're a smart gambler. Stannis has proved himself in war. Twice. His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield. Neither has the false king, Joffrey.",davos
Stannis has just begun the fight. His bannermen will rally to his cause. There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honorable than Stannis Baratheon. Or more worthy of loyalty.,davos
Matthos.,davos
"Of course you do. Every time you leave harbor, you're leaving on a promise. A promise that somewhere on the seas, somebody's got some gold and you can take it from them.",davos
"As is mine. You're not the young man, Salladhor. And correct me if I'm wrong",davos
"You want to spend your last few years on the sea, stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Midanese silk merchants, then go. They're out there waiting for you. That's easy. What I'm offering you is hard. Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros. You'll be the richest man in Lysene. And the most famous. They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing.",davos
It is. .,davos
The queen?,davos
He's young yet. I promise you the gold. I promise you the glory. I cannot promise you the queen.,davos
He is the one true king.,davos
Get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will.,davos
As soon as his God wills it.,davos
Oh you and your mother.,davos
"I wish I had a God, truly! I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every God there is. Pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home. None of it works!",davos
I wasn't praying.,davos
"You want me to have a god, fine. King Stannis is my god. He raised me up and blessed me with his trust. He gave you a future I could never have imagined. You know how to read, you'll be a knight someday. You think your fire god commanded all that? It was Stannis. Only Stannis.",davos
Don't tell him that.,davos
Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him.,cersei lannister
I have every right. I am the King's Hand.,tyrion lannister
You're serving as the King's Hand until father gets here. I am Queen Regent.,cersei lannister
"Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?",tyrion lannister
"Ha, the people. You think I care?",cersei lannister
"You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, “The Queen slaughters babies.” . You don't even have the decency to deny it.",tyrion lannister
"It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse.",tyrion lannister
"He did what needed to be done. . You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep.",cersei lannister
"I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that.",tyrion lannister
"I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. . It's all fallen on me.",cersei lannister
"As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon.",tyrion lannister
"You're funny. . You've always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death.",cersei lannister
She was my mother too.,tyrion lannister
"Now they're gone, for the sake of you. There's no bigger joke in the world than that. .",cersei lannister
Your Grace.,davos
How did it fare with your pirate?,stannis baratheon
Salladhor Saan will join our fleet. 30 ships. His men know how to fight.,davos
"In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men.",stannis baratheon
Does seem the wiser choice.,davos
It won't be a choice this time. Do you trust him?,stannis baratheon
"Salladhor Saan is an old friend, I've known him 30 years. I've never trusted him.",davos
"Well if he does his job, he'll have his share. Leave us.",stannis baratheon
"At once, Your Grace.",davos
Come.,davos
What did you say to him?,stannis baratheon
Why?,stannis baratheon
Yeah.,stannis baratheon
Tell your lord to burn them then.,stannis baratheon
My little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts. Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.,stannis baratheon
"Faith? In a real war, the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten.",stannis baratheon
"I cannot defeat my brother in the field, and I can't take King's Landing without the men he stole.",stannis baratheon
"I've said the words, damn you! I burnt the idols.",stannis baratheon
I have a wife. I took a vow.,stannis baratheon
A son?,stannis baratheon
Lord Commander-,jon snow
Lord Commander-,sam
"I followed him. He took the baby into the woods, the newborn.",jon snow
"No, you don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys...",jon snow
You know.,jon snow
Offerings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.,jon snow
I... I saw it. I saw... something take that child.,jon snow
Gilly.,sam
"I, I wanted to give you something. It belonged to my mother.",sam
Please. I want you to. My mother used it for sewing. She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and I'd read to her. My father put a stop to it when he found out. It's the only thing I have of hers. She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.,sam
I'm not giving it away. I'm giving it to you.,sam
Keep it safe for me. Til I come back.,sam
"Your Grace, I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard.",brienne
"I will be one of your seven, pledge my life to yours, and keep you safe from all harm.",brienne
Lord of Winterfell and King in the North.,catelyn stark
You are most kind.,catelyn stark
"It will be enough to know that justice was done, my lord.",catelyn stark
Your Grace. And you should kneel when you approach the King.,brienne
"I do not sit on my son's war councils. And if I did, I would not share his strategies with you.",catelyn stark
"My son is fighting a war, not playing at one.",catelyn stark
"And all of them young and bold like your Knight of Flowers? It's a game to you, isn't it? I pity them.",catelyn stark
Because it won't last. Because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming.,catelyn stark
"At once, Your Grace. Shall I return after?",brienne
"If you'll follow me, my lady.",brienne
"You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne.",catelyn stark
"I fought for my king. Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield. Die for him if I must. And, if it please you, Brienne's enough. I'm no lady.",brienne
What are you doing here?,theon greyjoy
You lying bitch.,theon greyjoy
Recognize you? How could I? The last time I saw you- you looked like a fat little boy.,theon greyjoy
Why didn't you tell me?,theon greyjoy
Father.,theon greyjoy
And what's my role in all this?,theon greyjoy
A ship? You give her thirty and I get one?,theon greyjoy
I'm to fight fishermen?,theon greyjoy
"Father, I fought with Robb Stark. I know his men. He won't give up the North so easily.",theon greyjoy
"What do you know of it, woman? I'm a proven warrior.",theon greyjoy
"I'm not protecting anyone. I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait. Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies? Rise up against them and they could destroy us. But if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock.",theon greyjoy
We do not sow.,theon greyjoy
"You act as if I volunteered to go. You gave me away, if you remember. The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon. After he crushed you. Did you take what was yours then?",theon greyjoy
You gave me away!,theon greyjoy
Your boy! Your last boy! You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore. And now you curse me because I've come home.,theon greyjoy
I have no other family.,theon greyjoy
Keep your voice down.,tyrion lannister
I don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.,tyrion lannister
"Again, only temporary.",tyrion lannister
But you wouldn't be a cook. You'd pose as a scullion.,tyrion lannister
Kitchen wench.,tyrion lannister
"Yes, but-",tyrion lannister
Your lion wants to see you alive. We've come to a dangerous place. My sister wants to hurt me. She'll look for any weakness she can find. She can't know about you.,tyrion lannister
"It's a compliment, my lady.",tyrion lannister
Language can be a bit tricky here.,tyrion lannister
"Soon, darling, when the war is over.",cersei lannister
The princess just spoke to you.,cersei lannister
"Pardon, Your Grace. I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella. I'm counting the days until the fighting is done and I can pledge my love to the King in sight of the gods.",sansa stark
He might.,cersei lannister
Would you like that?,cersei lannister
"Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty. Won't you, little dove?",cersei lannister
Come in.,sansa stark
Who are you?,sansa stark
I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden. You're not from here.,sansa stark
What are you doing?,sansa stark
I shouldn't have to tell you to do things. You should just do them.,sansa stark
"Change my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair.",sansa stark
No.,sansa stark
Not now.,sansa stark
Clean the table.,sansa stark
Have you ever been a handmaiden before?,sansa stark
For whom?,sansa stark
Lady Zuriff,sansa stark
There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.,sansa stark
"I don't know how they did things in that city, but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies, not the other way around. And I don't have time to answer a thousand questions and teach you how to do your job.",sansa stark
Just brush my hair.,sansa stark
Oh! Thank the gods. I haven't had a proper shit in six days.,tyrion lannister
Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.,tyrion lannister
Please.,tyrion lannister
"I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?",tyrion lannister
These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.,tyrion lannister
"I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake.",tyrion lannister
"I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it.",tyrion lannister
"But remember, the Queen mustn't know.",tyrion lannister
"Ooh. ""The Queen mustn't know."" I love conversations that begin this way.",varys
I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.,tyrion lannister
"Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell. He fights for Robb Stark.",varys
Precisely.,tyrion lannister
Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships.,tyrion lannister
"But remember, you must tell no one.",tyrion lannister
Tell no one what?,petyr baelish
I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.,tyrion lannister
She imprisoned you. She tried to execute you. And you offer her son a princess?,petyr baelish
"For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?",tyrion lannister
And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?,petyr baelish
Who better?,tyrion lannister
"Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?",petyr baelish
"The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold... and Harrenhal.",tyrion lannister
Harrenhal is cursed.,petyr baelish
"Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands.",tyrion lannister
"With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm.",petyr baelish
You served my family well in the matter of the succession.,tyrion lannister
"So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too. Until you snatched it away.",petyr baelish
"I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then?",tyrion lannister
Good. Oh. And remember-,tyrion lannister
The Queen mustn't know.,petyr baelish
You monster. Myrcella is my only daughter. Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?,cersei lannister
Myrcella's a princess. Some would say she was born for this.,tyrion lannister
I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.,cersei lannister
Dorne is the safest place for her.,tyrion lannister
Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.,cersei lannister
That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started.,tyrion lannister
She'll be a hostage.,cersei lannister
A guest.,tyrion lannister
"You won't get away with this. You think the piece of paper Father gave you keeps you safe. Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too.",cersei lannister
"It's done, Cersei.",tyrion lannister
No.,cersei lannister
You cannot stop it.,tyrion lannister
No!,cersei lannister
"Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours.",tyrion lannister
Get out! Get out!,cersei lannister
I would.,theon greyjoy
What is dead may never die.,theon greyjoy
"I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf. If Myrcella marries the Martell boy, she can't very well marry Robin Arryn, can she?",petyr baelish
"No, afraid not. Sorry about that.",tyrion lannister
"And Harrenhal, I suppose that's off the table as well.",petyr baelish
"Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too.",tyrion lannister
Leave me out of your next deception.,petyr baelish
"Oh, that's a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade. I would see him released. That's where you come in.",tyrion lannister
Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.,petyr baelish
"No, he won't. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?",tyrion lannister
Find him?,tyrion lannister
"Oh, aye. And he has company. Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt.",bronn
"No, you don't.",tyrion lannister
"No, I don't.",bronn
"You disappoint me, Grand Maester.",tyrion lannister
So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.,tyrion lannister
"See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you.",tyrion lannister
Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.,tyrion lannister
"Well, make do.",tyrion lannister
How long have you been spying for my sister?,tyrion lannister
I don't like his beard.,tyrion lannister
"How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?",tyrion lannister
So you poisoned him?,tyrion lannister
"But you let him die, made sure he succumbed.",tyrion lannister
Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells.,tyrion lannister
For your trouble.,tyrion lannister
You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.,varys
Good. One of my better ideas.,tyrion lannister
And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell?,varys
"Well played, My Lord Hand. But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle - The Small Council grows smaller every day.",varys
The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.,tyrion lannister
"Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?",varys
"Why, am I about to hear one?",tyrion lannister
"Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies?",varys
Depends on the sellsword.,tyrion lannister
Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods.,varys
"He has a sword, the power of life and death.",tyrion lannister
"But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?",varys
I've decided I don't like riddles.,tyrion lannister
"Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow.",varys
I can't sleep.,arya stark
I don't like the taste.,arya stark
How do you sleep?,arya stark
"But you've seen things, horrible things.",arya stark
How do you sleep when you... when you have those things in your head?,arya stark
"I close my eyes and I see them up there. All of them standing there. Joffrey, the Queen and... and my sister.",arya stark
Get up.,arya stark
"No, I'm not afraid.",arya stark
"We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton.",robb stark
I doubt it.,robb stark
My father outlawed flaying in the North.,robb stark
We're not torturing them.,robb stark
The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own. I won't give them an excuse to abuse my sisters.,robb stark
You'll die if she doesn't.,robb stark
Put this in your mouth and lie down. You don't want to watch.,robb stark
"Bite on it. It's better than biting your own tongue, believe me.",robb stark
What's your name?,robb stark
Your last name?,robb stark
You know my family name. You have me at a disadvantage.,robb stark
They killed my father.,robb stark
The family he fights for.,robb stark
I have no hatred for the lad.,robb stark
"You'd have us surrender, end all this bloodshed. I understand. The country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey.",robb stark
If the gods give me strength.,robb stark
I don't know. We'll go back to Winterfell. I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.,robb stark
I don't know.,robb stark
First we have to win the war.,robb stark
You never told me where you're from.,robb stark
Volantis? You're far from home. The boy was lucky you were here.,robb stark
"Your Grace, whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part. You know that. I beg you, please",sansa stark
What is the meaning of this?,tyrion lannister
What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?,tyrion lannister
"Careful, now. We don't want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak.",bronn
Someone get the girl something to cover herself with. She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor?,tyrion lannister
"For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit.",tyrion lannister
The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?,tyrion lannister
"I'm not threatening the king, ser. I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference?",tyrion lannister
I apologize for my nephew's behavior. Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement?,tyrion lannister
"I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love.",sansa stark
"Lady Stark, you may survive us yet.",tyrion lannister
The little king's backed up. Clogged from balls to brains.,bronn
You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?,tyrion lannister
There's no cure for being a cunt. But the boy's at that age. And he's got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies. Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.,bronn
Your Grace.,petyr baelish
I'm a practical man.,petyr baelish
And who would you have me be loyal to? Your brother's corpse?,petyr baelish
"You still have many friends at court, Your Grace, many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim.",petyr baelish
I would give priority to my head.,petyr baelish
"I understand that you don't like me, and while that saddens me greatly, I did not come here today seeking your affection. When you march on King's Landing, you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or open gates.",petyr baelish
All of these tents look the same to me. Would you be so kind-,petyr baelish
"Your tent""? Not ""Our tent""? The king snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers solitude? Pressures of command, no doubt. Four kings vying for the throne.",petyr baelish
"If war were arithmetic, the mathematicians would rule the world. I did notice your brother entering His Grace's tent just now.",petyr baelish
"And on the night of your wedding, who was by the king's side then?",petyr baelish
"Your marriage is quite interesting. Not only to me, but to the realm. The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else.",petyr baelish
"I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly.",petyr baelish
This isn't your horse.,daenerys targaryen
Qarth?,daenerys targaryen
Will they let us in?,daenerys targaryen
What do you know of this place?,daenerys targaryen
"Only that the desert around their walls is called the Garden of Bones. Every time the Qartheen shut their gates on a traveler, the garden grows.",jorah mormont
Dragonfire.,arya stark
Dead people.,arya stark
Does anyone live?,arya stark
Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.,arya stark
How dare you?,catelyn stark
You may have heard false reports.,petyr baelish
You betrayed Ned.,catelyn stark
Betrayed? I wanted him to serve as Protector of the Realm. I begged him to seize the moment.,petyr baelish
I trusted you. My husband trusted you. And you repaid our faith with treachery.,catelyn stark
"No, my lady.",petyr baelish
Get out!,catelyn stark
"Cat, I've I've loved you since I was a boy. It seems to me that fate has given us this chance",petyr baelish
Have you lost your mind? Get out!,catelyn stark
"Do you want to see your girls again? Sansa, more beautiful than ever? And Arya, just as wild as ever?",petyr baelish
"You have Arya, too?",catelyn stark
Both girls are healthy and safe. For now. But you know the Queen and you know Joffrey. I fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital.,petyr baelish
What do you want?,catelyn stark
The Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer.,petyr baelish
Of course they will. Jaime Lannister for two girls? Robb will never agree to those terms.,catelyn stark
I'm not bringing these terms to him. I'm bringing them to you.,petyr baelish
You think I keep secrets from my son?,catelyn stark
"Robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle, but he's not a mother. Consider it, Cat. You may not get another chance. I've brought you a gift.",petyr baelish
I don't want your gifts. A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill. He wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners is offered in good faith.,catelyn stark
Good faith?,catelyn stark
What's this?,catelyn stark
Your husband was an honorable man. He should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath Winterfell. You may not believe,petyr baelish
Get out.,catelyn stark
The Mountain. What are you doing?,arya stark
Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.,arya stark
Polliver. The Mountain.,arya stark
"Lady Stark, I had not thought to find you in the Stormlands.",stannis baratheon
"I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis.",catelyn stark
Who else might it be?,stannis baratheon
My own.,stannis baratheon
"Watch yourself, Renly.",stannis baratheon
That's twice I've warned you.,stannis baratheon
"Listen to yourselves. If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers.",catelyn stark
"It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark. Your husband was a supporter of my claim. Lord Eddardo s integrity cost him his head. And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me.",stannis baratheon
We share a common enemy.,catelyn stark
The Iron Throne is mine by right. All those that deny that are my foes.,stannis baratheon
"For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider. Strike your banners, come to me before dawn, and I will grant you your old seat in the Council. I'll even name you my heir until a son is born to me. Otherwise I shall destroy you.",stannis baratheon
You think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?,stannis baratheon
"We shall see, Renly. Come the dawn, we shall see.",stannis baratheon
I thought we were welcome.,daenerys targaryen
"If you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city, you might do the same, Khaleesi.",jorah mormont
Horde?,daenerys targaryen
My name is Daenerys-,daenerys targaryen

And what should I call you?,daenerys targaryen
The beauty of Quarth is legendary-,daenerys targaryen
Qarth.,daenerys targaryen
"My friend, we have traveled very far. We have no food, no water. Once I see my people fed, I would be honored",daenerys targaryen
I am not a liar.,daenerys targaryen
"Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates.",daenerys targaryen
What are you doing? You promised to receive me.,daenerys targaryen
"If you do not let us in, all of us will die.",daenerys targaryen
"Khaleesi, please be careful.",jorah mormont
"Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me. We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground. Turn us away and we will burn you first.",daenerys targaryen
What's this?,tywin lannister
Evidently not. Why are these prisoners not in their cells?,tywin lannister
Are we so well-manned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers?,tywin lannister
"You, do you have a trade?",tywin lannister
"He'll do no such thing. This one's a girl, you idiot, dressed as a boy. Why?",tywin lannister
"Safer to travel, my lord.",arya stark
Smart. More than I can say for this lot. Get these prisoners to work. Bring the girl. I need a new cupbearer.,tywin lannister
"Your visits are too few, cousin.",tyrion lannister
So it is. Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.,tyrion lannister
"If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself. Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that?",tyrion lannister
And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?,tyrion lannister
And you've waited this long to deliver the information?,tyrion lannister
"Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf.",tyrion lannister
She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn.,tyrion lannister
"Ah. Lavender oil. She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl.",tyrion lannister
"An anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?",tyrion lannister
Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?,tyrion lannister
"Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight?",tyrion lannister
"Did he tell you to fuck her, too?",tyrion lannister
"Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this.",tyrion lannister
Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.,tyrion lannister
"No, I think not.",tyrion lannister
"You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything. And you will tell me.",tyrion lannister
"Oh, rise, rise. Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it's all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent.",tyrion lannister
"Oh, I'll give her Pycelle.",tyrion lannister
"Yes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length.",tyrion lannister
Your Grace.,davos
Do your knuckle bones bring you luck?,stannis baratheon
"Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace. And it's four less fingernails to clean.",davos
Fewer.,stannis baratheon
Pardon?,davos
Four fewer fingernails to clean. Never understood why you had to wear them.,stannis baratheon
It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now. It reminds me of your justice. It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver.,davos
"You were a hero and a smuggler. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good.",stannis baratheon
A lesson I've tried to teach my son.,davos
Does he listen?,stannis baratheon
"To me? Gods, no. But if your Red Woman told him to leap from the crow's nest",davos
She has a name. I trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks.,stannis baratheon
I've lived within the law for seventeen-,davos
I want you to be a smuggler this time.,stannis baratheon
"Any shore, any night. What am I bringing ashore?",davos
The Red Woman. No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again.,stannis baratheon
"I am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways.",davos
Cleaner ways don't win wars.,stannis baratheon
Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors.,davos
"I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad.",davos
And which are you?,davos
"Well, that must be very nice for you.",davos
I do.,davos
Don't talk about my wife.,davos
Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows.,davos
These weren't here before. They've barred the passage.,davos
Gods protect us.,davos
By the mother. My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.,catelyn stark
And the wording of this oath?,catelyn stark
And in return for my son's loyalty?,catelyn stark
"Our two houses have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle. Negotiate a peace with your brother.",catelyn stark
No! No.,brienne
"No, wait, it wasn't her!",catelyn stark
We've got to leave. They'll hang you for this.,catelyn stark
I won't leave him.,brienne
You can't avenge him if you're dead.,catelyn stark
Not that way.,brienne
"My lord, my lady.",petyr baelish
"Stannis will be here in an hour. When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him. Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king.",petyr baelish
"You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis.",petyr baelish
Stannis.,petyr baelish
"Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world?",petyr baelish
"I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today. You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground. If it is justice that you want, be smart about it.",petyr baelish
"He was, Your Grace.",petyr baelish
Do you want to be a queen?,petyr baelish
Killed? By whom?,cersei lannister
Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.,tyrion lannister
Really? Who'd have thought?,cersei lannister
"Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour.",tyrion lannister
"Whomever did it, I say well done.",cersei lannister
"It's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea.",tyrion lannister
Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.,cersei lannister
"And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later.",tyrion lannister
"Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?",cersei lannister
She'll be safer in Dorne.,tyrion lannister
"Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety.",cersei lannister
"It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you.",tyrion lannister
So clever. Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?,cersei lannister
Schemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us. We need to be ready.,tyrion lannister
No need to concern yourself over it. The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations.,cersei lannister
May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?,tyrion lannister
"You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same.",cersei lannister
It's important that we talk about this.,tyrion lannister
It's the king's royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors.,cersei lannister
"Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?",tyrion lannister
MThat's a lie right there.,tyrion lannister
"Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean.",tyrion lannister
The smart money would be on more likely.,tyrion lannister
But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.,tyrion lannister
I suppose there's only one way to find out.,tyrion lannister
When did she tell you this?,tyrion lannister
Swear to me on what?,tyrion lannister
But I don't care about your life.,tyrion lannister
"All right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out.",tyrion lannister
"Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me.",tyrion lannister
It will be my pleasure.,bronn
Your Grace.,davos
What is it?,stannis baratheon
"I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace, I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him.",davos
"Fools love a fool. I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be.",stannis baratheon
I need to speak to you - about what I saw in that cave.,davos
I thought I made it clear to you there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter.,stannis baratheon
"Your Grace, I-",davos
I've never known you to need to hear a thing twice.,stannis baratheon
And I've never known you to hide from the truth.,davos
You've come to lecture me on truth?,stannis baratheon
I've come to tell you that what I saw.,davos
"All my brother's bannermen have come to my side. Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards. They won't be able to resist us now. Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne.",stannis baratheon
"Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron",davos
I'll hear no more about it.,stannis baratheon
When do we sail for King's Landing?,davos
"As soon as I've consolidated my troops. We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet. Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city.",stannis baratheon
And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?,davos
That's not your concern.,stannis baratheon
"If you take King's Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers.",davos
I never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?,stannis baratheon
Loyal service means telling hard truths.,davos
"Oh, truth again. All right, what's the truth? The hard truth?",stannis baratheon
She's a foreigner preaching her foreign religion. Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey.,davos
What do you believe?,stannis baratheon
You won those bannermen from Renly. Don't lose them to her.,davos
We set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre. And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.,stannis baratheon
"Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them. The other lords won't be happy.",davos
"Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason. Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos.",stannis baratheon
"Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses. What do we have?",tyrion lannister
There's that mind of yours you keep going on about.,bronn
"Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it.",tyrion lannister
Good thing. I'd be out of a job. What about your father?,bronn
"He hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it.",tyrion lannister
It's hard to argue with his assessment.,tyrion lannister
Not after what he did to your birthday present.,bronn
The king is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.,tyrion lannister
You have to admire his imagination.,tyrion lannister
He's talking about you.,bronn
What? Demon monkey?,tyrion lannister
People think you're pulling the king's strings. They blame you for the city's ills.,bronn
Blame me? I'm trying to save them.,tyrion lannister
You don't need to convince me.,bronn
Demon monkey.,tyrion lannister
You're the crew of the Sea Bitch? I'm your commander. Welcome.,theon greyjoy
Stop. Stop! Your captain commands you to stop!,theon greyjoy
"The Stony Shore, to raid their villages. There'll be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do your jobs well.",theon greyjoy
I do. Your captain.,theon greyjoy
"You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own. And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor.",theon greyjoy
Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.,theon greyjoy
You'd better get out there. Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.,theon greyjoy
Who are you?,theon greyjoy
Why aren't you with the rest of them? Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea? That would be good for a laugh.,theon greyjoy
And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?,theon greyjoy
And yet that's the task my father has given me to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.,theon greyjoy
The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.,theon greyjoy
"No, we could. We could never hold it for more than a few days. As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back. And then-",theon greyjoy
Take me to my ship.,theon greyjoy
The Starks understand winter better than we ever will. The cold won't beat them.,tywin lannister
"And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords. This is war, no one's content. We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long. He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him. And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North. You've been waiting for him to fail. He is not going to fail, not without our help. So how do we stop him?",tywin lannister
"Yes, I think you would, Reginald. And because you're my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep. Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you.",tywin lannister
"Well, then you'd better start riding. Go, before I change my mind and send her your head.",tywin lannister
"If your name wasn't Lannister, you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent. Go!",tywin lannister
"Not wine, water. We'll be here for some time. Girl, where are you from?",tywin lannister
"Maidenpool, my lord.",arya stark
And who are the Lords of Maidenpool? Remind me.,tywin lannister
"House Mooton, my lord.",arya stark
And what is their sigil?,tywin lannister
"A red salmon. I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that. You're a Northerner, aren't you?",tywin lannister
"Good. One more time, where are you from?",tywin lannister
"Barrowton, my lord. House Dustin. Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown.",arya stark
And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?,tywin lannister
They call him the Young Wolf.,arya stark
And?,tywin lannister
They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf. They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants. They say he can't be killed.,arya stark
And do you believe them?,tywin lannister
"No, my lord. Anyone can be killed.",arya stark
Fetch that water.,tywin lannister
I was always a girl.,arya stark
You're one of them now. I should have let you burn.,arya stark
I didn't have a choice.,arya stark
Three what?,arya stark
I can name anyone and you'll kill him?,arya stark
The one who tortures everyone.,arya stark
I don't know his name. They call him the Tickler.,arya stark
When will he come?,jon snow
My uncle told me stories about him.,jon snow
I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.,jon snow
So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.,jon snow
"Beautiful, isn't it? Gilly would love it here.",sam
"The Fist of the First Men. Think of how old this place is. Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men.",sam
"Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we're standing all through the long night. What do you think they were like, the First Men?",sam
I think they were afraid. I think they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked.,jon snow
One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts.,jon snow
"And three for White Walkers. It's been a thousand years, but that's the only time they blow the horn three times.",sam
Well I read it in a book.,sam
Look. It's Qhorin Halfhand.,jon snow
"I remember reading an old sailors' proverb, ""Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off. """,tyrion lannister
My companion takes issue.,tyrion lannister
If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit. No offense meant.,bronn
To do what?,bronn
How much do you have?,tyrion lannister
"If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father.",bronn
"I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy. 'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us. Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down.",bronn
My friend remains unconvinced.,tyrion lannister
"Well, he's not living anymore. And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks.",bronn
This is a shit idea.,bronn
"I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene. The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low. You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer. You'll be making it for me.",tyrion lannister
Dracarys. Dracarys.,daenerys targaryen
He'll be able to feed himself from now on.,daenerys targaryen
"Let him sleep, Doreah.",daenerys targaryen
He loves you.,daenerys targaryen
"Thank you, my friend.",daenerys targaryen
"The last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo.",daenerys targaryen
"Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him. Men like to talk about other men when they're happy.",daenerys targaryen
It sounds wonderful.,daenerys targaryen
Please excuse me for a moment.,daenerys targaryen
What are they doing?,daenerys targaryen
"Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry. Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot. They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold. Very soft. He can chop off as much as we can carry.",jorah mormont
We are his guests! You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.,daenerys targaryen
Not even when we leave.,daenerys targaryen
Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more.,daenerys targaryen
My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built.,daenerys targaryen
It's not the only thing. They're quite good at killing the better men.,jorah mormont
That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.,daenerys targaryen
What is the House of the Undying?,daenerys targaryen
Do I know you?,jorah mormont
Who are you?,jorah mormont
It looked like Stannis.,brienne
To me it just looked like... A shadow in the shape of a man.,catelyn stark
In the shape of Stannis.,brienne
We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.,catelyn stark
"Will you stay there long, my lady?",brienne
"Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen. After that, I will leave for Winterfell. My two youngest need me. I've been away from them for far too long.",catelyn stark
I never knew my mother.,brienne
I'm sorry.,catelyn stark
My own mother died on the birthing bed when I was very young.,catelyn stark
It's a bloody business.,brienne
What comes after is even harder.,catelyn stark
"Once you're safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, my lady?",brienne
You mean to kill Stannis.,catelyn stark
I swore a vow.,brienne
But Stannis has a great army around him. His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.,catelyn stark
I'm as good as any of them. I should never have fled.,catelyn stark
Renly's death was no fault of yours. You served him bravely.,catelyn stark
I only held him that once as he was dying.,brienne
"He's gone, Brienne. You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth. Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well.",catelyn stark
"I do not know your son, my lady. But I could serve you, if you would have me. You have courage. Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I don't know, a woman's kind of courage. And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back. Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis.",brienne
"When the time comes, I will not hold you back.",catelyn stark
"Then I am yours, my lady. I will shield your back and give my life for yours, if it comes to that. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.",brienne
I vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.,catelyn stark
I don't see very well.,sam
A fire.,jon snow
Where?,jon snow
"Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin.",jon snow
I've fought and killed a wight. How many rangers can say that?,jon snow
"I could take up Jon's duties while he's gone, my lord. It would be no trouble.",sam
He's not my manservant and he's not in love with me. He's my advisor and he's my friend.,daenerys targaryen
And what about what a woman wants?,daenerys targaryen
To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne.,daenerys targaryen
Because I promised my khalasar I'd protect them and find them a safe home.,daenerys targaryen
I want them because they're mine by right. The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.,daenerys targaryen
And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you?,daenerys targaryen
"So you wanted more than you had and you took it. You're a conqueror, too. You're just less ambitious.",daenerys targaryen
"What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos? At the gates of the city, you bled for me. Why?",daenerys targaryen
And behind the door?,daenerys targaryen
And it can all be mine?,daenerys targaryen
All I have to do?,daenerys targaryen
That was a romantic proposal.,daenerys targaryen
If you cross the sea with an army you bought and a foreign husband who paid for it...,jorah mormont
The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another. Four false kings destroying the country.,daenerys targaryen
"To win Westeros, you need support from Westeros.",jorah mormont
The usurper is dead.,daenerys targaryen
"The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other.",daenerys targaryen
According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand?,jorah mormont
The time to strike is now. We need to find ships and an army or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world.,daenerys targaryen
"Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get. They'll give you ships and soldiers and they'll own you forever. Moving carefully is the hard way, but it's the right way.",jorah mormont
"And if I'd listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, we'd all be dead by now.",daenerys targaryen
"I know the opportunity before you seems like the last you'll ever have, but you musT-",jorah mormont
Do not speak to me like I'm a child.,daenerys targaryen
I only want-,jorah mormont
What do you want? Tell me.,daenerys targaryen
To see you on the Iron Throne.,jorah mormont
Why?,daenerys targaryen
"You have a good claim. A title. A birthright. But you have something more than that. You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart. You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved. Someone who can rule and should rule. Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world. There are times when I look at you and I still can't believe you're real.",jorah mormont
"So what would you have me do, as my advisor?",daenerys targaryen
"Make your own way. Find your own ship. You only need one. The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth.",jorah mormont
And how do I get the ship?,daenerys targaryen
I'll find it for you. A sound ship with a good captain.,jorah mormont
I look forward to meeting him.,daenerys targaryen

I've taken your castle.,theon greyjoy
It's Prince Theon now. Get up. You have to get dressed. I've taken Winterfell. I took it. I'm occupying it. I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes.,theon greyjoy
To take the castle.,theon greyjoy
And he sent me back to Pyke. I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight for Robb and my father both. Where's Hodor?,theon greyjoy
Find the halfwit.,theon greyjoy
My men are bringing your people together in the courtyard.,theon greyjoy
So you and I can go down and tell them - how you've yielded Winterfell to me.,theon greyjoy
"Yes, you will.",theon greyjoy
"The castle is mine. But these people are still yours. You'll yield to keep them safe, to keep them alive. That's what a good lord would do. Think carefully about what you want to say.",theon greyjoy
Louder. Say Prince Theon.,theon greyjoy
"Listen to your little lord, Farlen. He has more sense than you do.",theon greyjoy
My father has donned the ancient crown of Salt and Rock and declared himself King of the Iron Islands. He claims the North as well by right of conquest. You are all his subjects.,theon greyjoy

Inform her that she's to bring You are a maester of the Citadel, sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell, are you not?",theon greyjoy

I'm the one who took you. What of it?,theon greyjoy
"Serve me how? I need fighters, not kitchen sluts.",theon greyjoy
So you can bury it in my neck? Do you take me for a fool? Get up.,theon greyjoy
You'll all go about your tasks as usual. And in a few days' time-,theon greyjoy
"Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes.",theon greyjoy
They are not my people.,theon greyjoy
"My brothers are dead. They died fighting Stark men, men like you.",theon greyjoy
"Among them, but not one of them. I was his hostage, taken from my home.",theon greyjoy
He's not. He's dead. The Seven Kingdoms are at war. And Winterfell is mine.,theon greyjoy
"You've served this house faithfully, old man. But keep talking and I'll-",theon greyjoy
Take him to the cells. Lock him up,theon greyjoy
I'll lock him in a cell until he rots.,theon greyjoy
"Ser Rodrik, I sentence you to death!",theon greyjoy
The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.,theon greyjoy
"He disrespected me in front of my men. That was his decision, not mine.",theon greyjoy

This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand. It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.,tywin lannister
"Girl, fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses. It's the one on this-",tywin lannister
My cupbearer can read better than you.,tywin lannister
To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance?,tywin lannister
"To the Starks of Winterfell! Who have twenty thousand men and my son! I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants. I see I overestimated you. If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll Leave us.",tywin lannister

Thank you.,petyr baelish
What news from the capital?,tywin lannister
I traveled here directly from Renly Baratheon's camp.,petyr baelish
"Ah, the late King Renly. Rather a short reign. Murdered by a woman, I hear.",tywin lannister
So they say. There has been talk of other forces at work. Dark forces.,petyr baelish
Here. Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel.,tywin lannister
It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after.,petyr baelish
"You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it. Yes, a crisis is an opportunity. What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?",tywin lannister
"After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host. Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, feeding horses and soldiers.",petyr baelish
"Yes, yes, yes.",tywin lannister
The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings. Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly's death. And Margaery-,petyr baelish
Wants to be queen.,tywin lannister
"Yes, she does.",petyr baelish
House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne. Against my grandson.,tywin lannister
"They did. And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated.",petyr baelish
More wine for Lord Baelish.,tywin lannister

And what else?,tywin lannister
"On your son Tyrion's directive, I met with Catelyn Stark.",petyr baelish

But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons.",daenerys targaryen
Do you understand? I'm no ordinary woman. My dreams come true.,daenerys targaryen
"I am not your little princess. I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine. With fire and blood, I will take it.",daenerys targaryen
Who taught you to read?,tywin lannister
"My father, my lord.",arya stark
"Hmm. I taught my son Jaime to read. The maester came to me one day, told me he wasn't learning. He couldn't make sense of the letters. He reversed them in his head. The maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it. Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned. He hated me for it, for a time. For a long time. But he learned. Hmm. Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he?",tywin lannister
A stonemason.,arya stark
A stonemason who could read? Hmm.,tywin lannister
He taught himself.,arya stark
Quite a man. What killed him?,tywin lannister
Loyalty.,arya stark
"You're a sharp little thing, aren't you?",tywin lannister
"Did... Forgive me, my lord. I shouldn't ask questions.",arya stark
No. But you've already begun.,tywin lannister
"Did you know your father, my lord?",arya stark
I did. I grew up with him. I watched him grow old.,tywin lannister
"He loved us. He was a good man, but a weak man. A weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name. I'm cold.",tywin lannister
"I'll fetch more wood for the fire, my lord.",arya stark
Mmm.,tywin lannister
"The armory, my lord.",arya stark
Lord Tywin sent me.,arya stark
Lord Tywin gave it to me.,arya stark
To take to the armory.,arya stark
Amory Lorch.,arya stark
Now!,arya stark
But he's going to tell Tywin. He's getting away. It has to be now.,arya stark
Guard!,tywin lannister
Quent.,robb stark
Lady Talisa.,robb stark
"It's hard to keep all the rules straight. But if I remember my lessons, a woman of noble birth is always called a lady. Unless she's a queen or a princess. I could find someone who knows.",robb stark
Because it's obvious.,robb stark
I'd call you a liar.,robb stark
"Better at amputations, I'm afraid.",robb stark
Quite a pretty spot.,robb stark
I couldn't really discuss troop movements with you.,robb stark
"Of course, a spy would deny being a spy.",robb stark
"Perhaps you'd join me... If you've got time, of course, for, well-",robb stark
Robb.,catelyn stark
"Mother. Mother, this is Lady Talisa. She's been helping with the wounded. She's been very... helpful.",robb stark
Lady Talisa.,catelyn stark
Lady Talisa...?,catelyn stark
"Maegyr? Forgive me, I do not know this name.",catelyn stark
I've missed you.,robb stark
"Yes, you look positively forlorn.",catelyn stark
"You surprised me, that's all. I didn't think I'd see you today.",robb stark
I wish that you were free to follow your heart.,catelyn stark
I know.,robb stark
You have inherited your father's responsibilities. I'm afraid they come at a cost. You are promised to another.,catelyn stark
A debt that must be paid.,catelyn stark
I haven't forgotten.,robb stark
We'll stop here. Too dark to go any farther today.,jon snow
There's no shelter anywhere.,jon snow
No fire.,jon snow
Yes.,jon snow
We start again at first light. Get some sleep.,jon snow
Stop moving.,jon snow
Stop it!,jon snow
You're still moving.,jon snow
This cannot be true.,robb stark
Why? Why would Theon-,robb stark
My brothers?,robb stark
"I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!",catelyn stark
I must go north at once.,robb stark
How can I call myself king if I can't hold my own castle? How can I ask men to follow me if I can't-,robb stark
Let me go and talk to Theon.,catelyn stark
There will be no talk. He will die for this.,robb stark
"Tell your son Bran and Rickon's safety is paramount. And Theon, I want him brought to me alive. I want to look him in the eye and ask him why. And then I'll take his head myself.",robb stark
Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you?,theon greyjoy
All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone.,theon greyjoy
How? And don't tell me to put a spear in your hand.,theon greyjoy
"I'm a prince now, and you'd do well-",theon greyjoy
Like what?,theon greyjoy
You know things? Like what? How to eat dirt?,theon greyjoy
Wait outside.,theon greyjoy
I always wondered what you had under there.,theon greyjoy
I'm not killing you. That's your price.,theon greyjoy
"What do you want then, other than your miserable life?",theon greyjoy
"Well, you shall have it, then. But only if you serve me well.",theon greyjoy
Ow!,sansa stark
I thought they were going to kill me.,sansa stark
"He hated me, the man who hit me. I saw it in his eyes. Hated me. He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me.",sansa stark
Why? Why would a stranger-,sansa stark
I would have given them bread if I had it. I hate the king more than any of them.,sansa stark
But you're not the wrong people.,sansa stark
The Spice King refuses me because I'm a bad investment. The Silk King won't support me because of his business with the Lannisters. Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?,daenerys targaryen
Where are they? Where are my dragons?,daenerys targaryen
"A cripple? You let a cripple escape? The boy can't walk, but somehow he slipped past you?",theon greyjoy
"The giant? Hodor? Oh, that's all right, then. You let a halfwit escape with a cripple. And Rickon, too? The little one?",theon greyjoy
Right. Get the horses and the hounds.,theon greyjoy
Enjoying your first hunt?,theon greyjoy
"With hunting, there's blood at the end.",theon greyjoy
"I was a little boy when I was torn away from my home and brought here. So I kept my word. I never ran away. If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them. Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them.",theon greyjoy
They have no value to me missing.,theon greyjoy
"Robb's in the Riverlands. My sister's in Deepwood Motte. She'll get here long before they do. And Ned Stark always said 500 men could hold Winterfell again 10,000.",theon greyjoy
"The hounds have the scent. Come, Maester, don't look so grim. It's all just a game.",theon greyjoy
Let's move.,jon snow
I'm a man of the Night's Watch.,jon snow
Don't call them that.,jon snow
Neither. Both.,jon snow
Move!,jon snow
"There are no women of the Night's Watch, no.",jon snow
No.,jon snow
Never. We swore an oath.,jon snow
Would you please shut up?,jon snow
You're a free woman?,jon snow
"If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what ""prisoner"" means.",jon snow
It was my choice to say the words.,jon snow
Of course I like girls.,jon snow
That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.,jon snow
"Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!",jon snow
"My father was Ned Stark. I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours.",jon snow
Wolfsbane. A rare substance. This is no common assassin.,tywin lannister
I don't care if you hanged a hundred. A man tried to kill me. I want his name and I want his head.,tywin lannister
"Pretentious name for a band of outlaws. We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity. We look like fools and they look like heroes. That's how kings fall. I want them dead, every one.",tywin lannister
"Burn the villages, burn the farms. Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side.",tywin lannister
Mmm. Is that mutton?,tywin lannister
"Yes, my lord.",arya stark
Don't like mutton.,tywin lannister
I'll bring something else.,arya stark
Leave it. Are you hungry?,tywin lannister
No.,arya stark
Of course you are. Eat.,tywin lannister
I'll eat in the kitchen later.,arya stark
It's bad manners to refuse a lordo s offer. Sit. Eat.,tywin lannister
You're small for your age. I suppose you've been underfed your whole life.,tywin lannister
I eat a lot. I just don't grow.,arya stark
Mmm. This will be my last war. Win or lose.,tywin lannister
Have you ever lost before?,arya stark
Do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war?,tywin lannister
"But this is the one I'll be remembered for. The War of the Five Kings, they're calling it. My legacy will be determined in the coming months.",tywin lannister
Do you know what legacy means? It's what you pass down to your children and your children's children. It's what remains of you when you're gone. Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy. The greatest fortress ever built.,tywin lannister
"The tallest towers, the strongest walls. The Great Hall had thirty-five hearths. Thirty-five. Can you imagine? Look at it now. A blasted ruin. Do you know what happened?",tywin lannister
Dragons?,arya stark
Yes. Dragons happened.,tywin lannister
"Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land. A million men could have marched on these walls, and a million men would have been repelled. But an attack from the air with dragon fire, Mmm-mmm. Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls. Aegon Targaryen changed the rules. That's why every child alive still knows his name",tywin lannister
Aegon and his sisters.,arya stark
Mmm?,tywin lannister
"It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon. It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too.",arya stark
"Correct. A student of history, are you?",tywin lannister
Rhaenys rode Meraxes. Visenya rode Vhagar.,arya stark
I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.,tywin lannister
Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior. She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.,arya stark
"Hmm. She's a heroine of yours, I take it?",tywin lannister
Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?,tywin lannister
Most girls are idiots.,arya stark
You remind me of my daughter. Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?,tywin lannister
From my father.,arya stark
He was a well-read stonemason. Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.,tywin lannister
"Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?",arya stark
"Careful now, girl. I enjoy you, but be careful. Take that back to the kitchen. Eat what you want.",tywin lannister
"And, girl.",tywin lannister
M'lord.,tywin lannister
"Lowborn girls say ""m'lord,"" not ""my lord. "" If you're going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly.",tywin lannister
"My mother served Lady Dustin for many years, my lord. She taught me how to speak proper Properly.",arya stark
You're too smart for your own good. Has anyone told you that?,tywin lannister
Yes.,arya stark
Go on.,tywin lannister
"I beg pardon, ser. I should have come to you after to thank you for saving me. You were so brave.",sansa stark
Does it give you joy to scare people?,sansa stark
It was his duty. He never liked it.,sansa stark
Why are you always so hateful?,sansa stark
You are one of the Thirteen.,daenerys targaryen
Nothing? They're more valuable than anything in the world.,daenerys targaryen
"There is no we, so why would you help me get them back?",daenerys targaryen
But it did happen under your roof.,daenerys targaryen
I don't care where you've been.,daenerys targaryen
"No. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall.",jon snow
Walk.,jon snow
I know how to do it.,jon snow
And what did she say?,robb stark
And what then?,robb stark
"If every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton, we'd all hang.",robb stark
"You've acted with honor. I thank you for it. Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's pen is clean, and give him a hot supper.",robb stark
Is there room for Ser Alton?,robb stark
Have the men build him a new pen. Put him in with the Kingslayer for now. Have your boy watch over them.,robb stark
That will be all.,robb stark
"And my enemies, as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning.",robb stark
That's what I tell my bannermen.,robb stark
But some are not.,robb stark
If you need help finding these-,robb stark
"Continue, my lady.",robb stark
Yes.,robb stark
I expect he will.,robb stark
Come with me to the Crag.,robb stark
"Let the maester show you his stores. I want the wounded men to be treated well, all the wounded men.",robb stark
Try again.,theon greyjoy
"I'm looking at spending the rest of my life being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people. Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldn't do to stop that from happening? The hounds will find the scent again. I'll beat them until they do. I'll whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand. And once I've got them, the pampered little shits It's better to be cruel than weak.",theon greyjoy
Where are they?,theon greyjoy
The Stark boys. Where are they?,theon greyjoy
Think harder.,theon greyjoy
Go back to Winterfell. Take him back.,theon greyjoy
You came back.,daenerys targaryen
As soon as I heard. Do you know anything?,jorah mormont
Irri is dead.,daenerys targaryen
I know. She was a good-,jorah mormont
She's dead. She died alone. She died for me and I couldn't protect her.,daenerys targaryen
Doreah?,jorah mormont
"We can't find her. She must be dead, too. I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse.",daenerys targaryen
I should have been here.,jorah mormont
You went to find me a ship.,daenerys targaryen
My place is by your side. I shouldn't have left you alone with these people.,jorah mormont
"These people""?",daenerys targaryen
They are not to be trusted.,jorah mormont
"And who is to be trusted? Who are my people? The Targaryens? I only knew one, my brother, and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown. The Dothraki? Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse.",daenerys targaryen
Your people are in Westeros.,jorah mormont
The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.,daenerys targaryen
They will soon enough.,jorah mormont
And then what? They'll pray for my return? They'll wave dragon banners and shout my name? That's what my brother believed and he was a fool.,daenerys targaryen
"You are not your brother. Trust me, Khaleesi.",jorah mormont
"There it is. ""Trust me. "" And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you? I don't need trust any longer. I don't want it and I don't have room for it.",daenerys targaryen
You are too young to be so-,jorah mormont
And you are too familiar.,daenerys targaryen
"Forgive me, Khaleesi. No one can survive in this world without help. No one. Let me help you, please. Tell me how.",jorah mormont
Find my dragons.,daenerys targaryen
We're close.,jon snow
Nothing happened between you and me.,jon snow
Turn back around.,jon snow
"What, right here in the muck?",jon snow
That's enough.,jon snow
Enough!,jon snow
"No, no!",sansa stark
"No. Oh, no.",sansa stark
"If the Queen sees, I can have Joffrey's children now.",sansa stark
"Your mother might have prepared you. You flowered, my dear. No more.",cersei lannister
"My mother told me, but I thought it would be different.",sansa stark
In what way?,cersei lannister
I thought it would be less messy.,sansa stark
Wait until you birth a child.,cersei lannister
You're a woman now. Do you have any idea what that means?,cersei lannister
I'm fit to bear children for the king?,sansa stark
"A prospect that once delighted you, bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen.",cersei lannister
"Joffrey has always been difficult. Even his birth, I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world. You cannot imagine the pain. I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood.",cersei lannister
His Grace was not with you?,sansa stark
"Robert was hunting. That was his custom. Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds. And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head, and I would present him with a baby. Not that I wanted him there, mind you. I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother. When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out. Joffrey will show you no such devotion.",cersei lannister
"You may never love the king, but you will love his children.",cersei lannister
I love His Grace with all my heart.,sansa stark
"That's so very touching to hear. Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. The more people you love, the weaker you are. You'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do. You'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe. Love no one but your children. On that front, a mother has no choice.",cersei lannister
"But shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace?",sansa stark
"You can try, little dove.",cersei lannister
Who did you say your mother was again?,jaime lannister
Is she the fat one?,jaime lannister
"No, no. There's only one fat Lannister. If she was your mother, you'd know it.",jaime lannister
When?,jaime lannister
I went to Willem Frey's wedding?,jaime lannister
He threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds. What was his name?,jaime lannister
"Poor lad. That was my brother's doing, I seem to recall. I remember you. You'd never squired for anyone before.",jaime lannister
"You didn't, though.",jaime lannister
"You knew when you were needed and when to go away. It's a rare talent. Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them.",jaime lannister
You were saying?,jaime lannister
More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?,jaime lannister
I understand completely.,jaime lannister
"It's just that I, I was sixteen once. I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice.",jaime lannister
Barristan Selmy. The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws. Before your time.,jaime lannister
"He was a painter. A painter who only used red. I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then. And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect. I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you.",jaime lannister
"It's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life.",jaime lannister
"No. I didn't have your gift. He couldn't take a step without stepping on me. I was awful, a complete liability. Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a sixteen-year-old squire.",jaime lannister
"It's a good thing I am who I am. I'd have been useless at anything else. I'm not well-suited for imprisonment. Shocking, I know. Some men are. Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end. Not me, though. My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint.",jaime lannister
Of course. Every day.,jaime lannister
"Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently. The Starks are very careful.",jaime lannister
"But there is a way, I think. It wasn't possible until now.",jaime lannister
It's actually quite simple.,jaime lannister
You'll only have to do one thing.,jaime lannister
You'll have to die.,jaime lannister
I didn't come here for lessons.,jorah mormont
You have them? Where are they?,jorah mormont
Where are the dragons?,jorah mormont
Never.,jorah mormont
"Please, they're my children. I'm begging you.",daenerys targaryen
"Without me, the dragons will die.",daenerys targaryen
How?,daenerys targaryen
You have my dragons?,daenerys targaryen
But there is no King of Qarth.,daenerys targaryen
No farther.,brienne
"Don't enter without an invitation, man.",brienne
What is it?,catelyn stark
"Lord Karstark, this man is our prisoner.",catelyn stark
"And crippled mine. He will answer for his crimes, I promise you, but not here.",catelyn stark
"You will strike me down? Have you forgotten me, ser? I am the widow of your liege, Lord Eddard Stark. I am the mother of your king!",catelyn stark
You know very well.,robb stark
How dare you!,catelyn stark
Threatening my lady is an act of treason.,brienne
"I understand your grief, my lord, better than most, I understand it. But in the name of my son, the King in the North, stand down.",catelyn stark
Wise men do not make demands of kings.,catelyn stark
"Thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark. I would have come to your defense, but-",jaime lannister
Take him to the stockades. Bind him with every chain you can find!,catelyn stark
You've become a real she-wolf in your later years. There's not much fish left in you.,jaime lannister
And gag him!,catelyn stark
Since when do you light your own candles?,tyrion lannister
Since I decided that I can't stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant.,cersei lannister
How many times can you read one raven scroll?,cersei lannister
"Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, two hundred ships.",tyrion lannister
More than we have.,cersei lannister
"Yes, that's more than we have. He'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind.",tyrion lannister
"We have strong, high walls. We'll rain fire down on them from above.",cersei lannister
"Rain fire on them from above."" You're quoting Father, aren't you?",tyrion lannister
"Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?",cersei lannister
"Call it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it. The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here. It's just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.",tyrion lannister
I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.,cersei lannister
He needs to start acting like a king. This war you started is coming to our doorstep. And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead,tyrion lannister
I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.,cersei lannister
I thought the girls might help him.,tyrion lannister
Did you?,cersei lannister
I was wrong. If we can't control him,tyrion lannister
Do you think I haven't tried? He doesn't listen to me.,cersei lannister
It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.,tyrion lannister
I always hoped he'd be like Jaime. He looks like him. In a certain light.,cersei lannister
The boy is more Robert than Jaime.,tyrion lannister
"Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty. Sometimes I wonder. What? If this is the price for what we've done, for our sins.",cersei lannister
Sins?,tyrion lannister
"The Targaryens wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? ""Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin.""",cersei lannister
"You've beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them.",tyrion lannister
"Your son returns at dawn, my lady?",brienne
So they say.,catelyn stark
"The Kingslayer won't last the night. The more they drink, the angrier they'll get. And when the Karstarks draw their swords Who wants to die defending a Lannister?",brienne
Come.,catelyn stark
I need to be alone with him.,catelyn stark
"Your orders, which I just gave you, are to leave me alone with him.",catelyn stark
"Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark? I believe it's my last night in this world. Is that a woman?",jaime lannister
Do you hear them out there? They want your head.,catelyn stark
Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.,jaime lannister
You strangled his son with your chains.,catelyn stark
Oh. Oh. Was he the one on guard duty? He was in my way. Any knight would have done the same.,jaime lannister
You are no knight. You have forsaken every vow you ever took.,catelyn stark
"So many vows. They make you swear and swear. Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak. But what if your father despises the king? What if the king massacres the innocent? It's too much. No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another. Where did you find this beast?",jaime lannister
"She is a truer knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer.",catelyn stark
"Kingslayer. What a king he was. Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back.",jaime lannister
You are a man without honor.,catelyn stark
"Do you know, I've never been with any woman but Cersei. So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned. What was the name of that bastard he fathered?",jaime lannister
Brienne.,catelyn stark
"No, that wasn't it. Snow, a bastard from the North. Now, when When good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it? No. You're not very good at pretending. You're an honest woman. You hated that boy, didn't you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman.",jaime lannister
Your sword.,catelyn stark
I told you what would happen. All of you. I told you what would happen if you served me loyally. And what would happen if you did not.,theon greyjoy
"If there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says, here is the answer to your question.",theon greyjoy
Envy isn't attractive.,theon greyjoy
You should be proud of your brother's achievement. I took the great castle of Winterfell with twenty men.,theon greyjoy
"I treated the Stark boys with honor, and they repaid me with treachery.",theon greyjoy
Before I had to kill them- I treated them-,theon greyjoy
Exactly.,theon greyjoy
They made me a promise,theon greyjoy
Don't call me,theon greyjoy
"If I hadn't killed them, the Northerners would think me weak.",theon greyjoy
I'm warning you.,theon greyjoy
You haven't brought enough men. How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot?,theon greyjoy
Is this a joke? Winterfell is the heart of the North.,theon greyjoy
He won't find out. We've killed all the ravens. We have all the horses. I've taken Winterfell. And I will keep Winterfell.,theon greyjoy
I don't intend to die.,theon greyjoy
"I couldn't do it. I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't-",jon snow
The others?,jon snow
They died because of me.,jon snow
I've never met her.,robb stark
"Frey, I suppose. I don't know her first name.",robb stark
An important bridge.,robb stark
"It was before they killed my father. I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time, but only if I crossed that bridge.",robb stark
"He was the best man I ever met. I know children always think that about their fathers, but",robb stark
"He once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them. The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect. The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect. The soldiers you order into battle. He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night. I didn't believe him. I asked him, ""How can a man be brave if he's afraid?"" ""That is the only time a man can be brave,"" he told me.",robb stark
He would have liked you.,robb stark
He didn't care much about gold or glory.,robb stark
Because we'll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated. And because I believe in justice.,robb stark
That would be a start.,robb stark
How? How?,robb stark
Tell me this isn't true.,robb stark
Why?,robb stark
For the girls.,catelyn stark
You betrayed me.,robb stark
Robb-,catelyn stark
No! You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway.,robb stark
"Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell. Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing. I have five children, and only one of them is free.",catelyn stark
"I grieve for your sons, my lord.",catelyn stark
"Killing Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children, but returning him to King's Landing may buy life for mine.",catelyn stark
Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool. You've weakened our position. You've brought discord into our camp. And you did it all behind my back. Make sure she's guarded day and night.,robb stark
Robb. How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer?,catelyn stark
Send another forty with our fastest horses.,robb stark

Damn.,jaime lannister
"You're much uglier in daylight. What's your name? I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin.",jaime lannister
A captive knight has a right to know his captor's identity.,jaime lannister
Brienne of Tarth.,brienne
"Tarth, Tarth, Tarth. Crescent moons and starbursts. Lord Selwyn Tarth. Your father. Do you have any brothers and sisters, my lady? It's a long way to King's Landing. Might as well get to know one another.",jaime lannister
Have you known many men? I suppose not. Women? Horses? Ah.,jaime lannister
"I didn't mean to give offense, my lady. Forgive me.",jaime lannister
"Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer.",brienne
Why do you hate me so much? Have I ever harmed you?,jaime lannister
"You've harmed others, those you were sworn to protect, the weak, the innocent.",brienne
Has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly?,jaime lannister
You will not provoke me to anger.,brienne
I already have. Look at you. You're ready to chop my head off. Do you think you could? Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight?,jaime lannister
I've never seen you fight.,brienne
The answer is no. There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me. You're not one of them.,jaime lannister
All my life men like you have sneered at me. And all my life I've been knocking men like you into the dust.,brienne
"If you're so confident, unlock my chains. Let's see what happens.",jaime lannister
Do you take me for an idiot? In!,brienne
"I took you for a fighter, a man Pardon. Woman of honor. Was I wrong? You're afraid.",jaime lannister
"Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer.",brienne
Surrender the Iron Throne?,tywin lannister
"No, a king who runs will not be king for long. He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight. Stannis, two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep.",tywin lannister
"Ha! The last time the scouts assured us of Stark's movement, he lured us into a trap. Which is why my son is his prisoner.",tywin lannister
Too close to Casterly Rock.,tywin lannister
He's a boy and he's never lost a battle. He'll risk anything at any time because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.,tywin lannister
"We'll ride at nightfall. I want a full night's march before he knows we're on the move. Clegane, you'll maintain a garrison here at Harrenhal. Track down this brotherhood and destroy them. The girl has proven herself a good servant. She'll stay on with you. See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings. He's poor company when he's sober, but he's better at his work.",tywin lannister
Where's Jaqen?,arya stark
I need him now. Lord Tywin's marching tonight.,arya stark
He's helping me.,arya stark
Where?,arya stark
They'll never trust me.,jon snow
What?,jon snow
I didn't.,jon snow
Do you have to do that here?,tyrion lannister
I like to keep me hands clean.,bronn
"Yes, but do you have to do it here?",tyrion lannister
You should start wearing the gold cloak.,tyrion lannister
I don't want to wear a gold cloak.,bronn
You're commander of the City Watch. You shouldn't be dressed like a common,tyrion lannister
"A cloak slows you down in a fight. Makes it hard to move quietly. And the gold catches the light, so you're nice and easy to spot at night.",bronn
"Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer. You're supposed to stand out.",tyrion lannister
We had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.,bronn
"Fine, fine. No gold cloak.",tyrion lannister
What?,tyrion lannister
What?,bronn
What? What? Why are you staring at me?,tyrion lannister
You don't want me cleaning me nails. You don't want me looking your way. Why am I here?,bronn
To help me plan the defense of King's Landing.,tyrion lannister
Stannis will be here any day.,tyrion lannister
And one of these explains how to beat him?,bronn
"An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros. "" By Archmaester Shevelathin. Shevelatesh.",tyrion lannister
Chevalteesh. I'd swap all your books for a few good archers.,bronn
My Lord Hand. Commander. I must compliment you on the gold cloaks' performance these last few weeks. Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery?,varys
I did not know. And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?,tyrion lannister
Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves.,bronn
For questioning?,tyrion lannister
No. It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.,bronn
We talked about this.,tyrion lannister
"Aye, we talked about it. Have you ever been in a city under siege? Maybe this part's not in your books. See, it's not the fighting that kills most people. It's the starving. Foodo s worth more than gold. Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes. Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other.",bronn
"The thieves, they love a siege. Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food. By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town.",bronn
"Given the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted.",varys
"Ah. ""The Great Sieges of Westeros."" Thrilling subject. Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan wasn't a better writer.",varys
"Stannis knows King's Landing. He knows where the walls are strongest, and he knows which gates are weakest. The Mud Gate. A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and it's only 50 yards from the water. That's where he'll land.",tyrion lannister
"And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan?",varys
We could throw books at his men.,bronn
We don't have that many books.,varys
"We don't have that many men, either.",bronn
What do we have?,varys
Pig shit.,tyrion lannister
I'm not cut out for this sort of work.,sam
Where do you think Jon is right now?,sam
"He's not dead. No, Jon's a great fighter.",sam
He's got a Valyrian steel sword.,sam
And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.,sam
The First Men made these marks. Help me with it.,sam
That's a Night's Watch cloak.,sam
Oh. Must be dragonglass.,sam
The maesters call it obsidian.,sam
I'm sorry. I'll-,arya stark
Where were you?,arya stark
"Tywin Lannister was right here, and now he's gone.",arya stark
How long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone?,arya stark
He's taking his army to attack my brother. I need him dead right now.,arya stark
You promised you'd help me.,arya stark
And you'll kill them? Anybody?,arya stark
All right. Jaqen H'ghar.,arya stark
That's right.,arya stark
I'm not joking. A man can go kill himself.,arya stark
No.,arya stark
I'll un-name you.,arya stark
If you help me and my friends escape.,arya stark
"Fine, Jaqen H'ghar.",arya stark
A girl will obey.,arya stark
"Thank you, Podrick.",tyrion lannister
Odd little boy.,cersei lannister
I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.,tyrion lannister
You and Varys both.,cersei lannister
Excellent lamprey pie. Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting. An inspiration for the troops. The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.,tyrion lannister
He's only a boy.,cersei lannister
Younger boys are off fighting his war.,tyrion lannister
He's not ready.,cersei lannister
"What is he, seventeen? Remember Jaime at seventeen?",tyrion lannister
"Better than you. Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't. His place is not on the battlefield.",cersei lannister
"It's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us.",tyrion lannister
Do you think I'm an idiot?,cersei lannister
"No, I'd say you possess above-average intelligence.",tyrion lannister
You shipped off my only daughter. And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die.,cersei lannister
He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Any dessert?,tyrion lannister
Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?,cersei lannister
Because he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it.,tyrion lannister
Because he doesn't have a cock.,cersei lannister
Neither do you.,tyrion lannister
"Perhaps I'm dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking.",cersei lannister
It's not that little.,tyrion lannister
Why are you smiling?,tyrion lannister
Because I'm happy.,cersei lannister
And why are you happy?,tyrion lannister
Because I have your little whore.,cersei lannister
I thought you preferred blondes.,tyrion lannister
"Such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good. Father will be so pleased.",cersei lannister
Why do you care who I fuck?,tyrion lannister
"Because a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed.",cersei lannister
This is madness. Stannis will be here in days. You need me.,tyrion lannister
"For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore. Lovely body. The bruises will heal in time.",cersei lannister
Where did you find her?,tyrion lannister
"Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully.",cersei lannister
You've forgotten the most important thing about whores.,tyrion lannister
"Oh? Well, you're the expert. Tell me.",cersei lannister
"You don't buy them, you only rent them.",tyrion lannister
"You're usually a better liar, baby brother. This one you like. You like her very much. Could it be love? Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough. Unless Joffrey is hurt. And then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer, too. And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt.",cersei lannister
And how do I know you haven't killed her already?,tyrion lannister
"Would you like to see her? I thought you might. Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore.",cersei lannister
I'm sorry they hurt you. You must be brave.,tyrion lannister
I promise I will free you.,tyrion lannister
Never.,tyrion lannister
"I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you're safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid.",tyrion lannister
Get out.,cersei lannister
Shae!,tyrion lannister
You're beautiful.,tyrion lannister
We have to be more careful.,tyrion lannister
There are people who want to hurt me.,tyrion lannister
I would kill for you. Do you know that? I expect I'll have to before this is over. You're mine.,tyrion lannister
Promise me.,tyrion lannister
Still no word?,robb stark
Theon has my brothers. If we storm the castle,robb stark
Send word to your son. Any Ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes.,robb stark
Any Ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy. He betrayed our cause. He betrayed me. And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs.,robb stark
How am I? I've had to arrest my mother. The Lannisters have my sisters. The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers. I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north.,robb stark
No. Forgive me. You're being kind. I have no right.,robb stark
That's not the kind of king I want to be.,robb stark
I don't know. The good kind. Most kings grew up as princes. They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown. I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.,robb stark
I'd like to hear you play the harp.,robb stark
How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men's feet?,robb stark
I don't want to marry the Frey girl.,robb stark
Shut up. What did you bring?,arya stark
"He didn't say. He just said, ""Walk through the gates.""",arya stark
He didn't say anything about the guards.,arya stark
We have to trust him.,arya stark
Shut up. Stay here if you're afraid.,arya stark
"If the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day.",davos
Will it hold?,stannis baratheon
"Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace.",davos
"I admire you, Ser Davos.",stannis baratheon
"I thank you, Your Grace.",davos
"Pleased to hear it. Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you. So you take the onion for your sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag.",stannis baratheon
"My son wishes me to change it. Three mermen with tridents, something like that. I understand why the older families look down at me.",davos
Do you? Why?,stannis baratheon
My father was a crabber.,davos
And?,stannis baratheon
"Well, sons of lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers. Our hands stink.",davos
And where were those lords when Storm's End starved?,stannis baratheon
Many fought bravely for your brother. Many fought for the Mad King.,davos
You defend these men who insult you behind your back.,stannis baratheon
Some are happy to do it to my face.,davos
"We were forgotten. Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes. The glorious rebels marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King, while I held Storm's End with five hundred men.",stannis baratheon
"No one has forgotten, Your Grace.",davos
No? Robert did. He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war. Renly never fought a day in his life.,stannis baratheon
He was only a boy.,davos
Then why'd he give him Storm's End?,stannis baratheon
"First, we ate the horses. We weren't riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine. I do like dogs. Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them. Then the rats. The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying. She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail. And then you made it through the lines. Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions.",stannis baratheon
"And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe.",davos
Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.,stannis baratheon
I was relieved they did not.,davos
"Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it. Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up. Insult or no, I gave it up. Because Robert was my older brother, and he was the king and I've always done my duty. But now, I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros. And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand.",stannis baratheon
"Your Grace, I pray I serve you well.",davos
I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge.,stannis baratheon
"No man can be in all rooms at all times. I have many little birds in the North, my lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell.",varys
"To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?",tyrion lannister
"A brave choice, Your Grace. I'm sure your men will line up behind you.",tyrion lannister
Imagine Stannis' terror.,tyrion lannister
I am trying.,varys
You're an intelligent man. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.,tyrion lannister
"Oh, no one disputes that, my lord, not even the multitudes who despise you.",varys
"I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men.",tyrion lannister
"I wish we could, too.",varys
What do you want? Tell me.,tyrion lannister
"If we're going to play, you'll have to start.",varys
"My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history. My sister became queen at the age of nineteen. When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock.",tyrion lannister
A most highborn plumber.,varys
The water never flowed better. And all the shit found its way to the sea. I never expected to have any real power. So when my father named me acting Hand,tyrion lannister
"You're quite good at being Hand, you know? Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men. Honorable men. But they disdained the game and those who played. You enjoy the game.",varys
I do. Last thing I expected.,tyrion lannister
And you play it well.,varys
"I'd like to keep playing it. If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over.",tyrion lannister
They say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light.,varys
"The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?",tyrion lannister
"In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with sixteen teats.",varys
We should sail there immediately.,tyrion lannister
"This morning, I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste. Daenerys Targaryen lives.",varys
A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.,tyrion lannister
"She has three dragons. But even if what they say is true, it'll be years before they are fully grown. And then there will be nowhere to hide.",varys
"One game at a time, my friend.",tyrion lannister
"Careful, Khaleesi. Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have a thousand eyes watching for you. I found one. A ship with a good captain. She leaves for Astapor tomorrow.",jorah mormont
Astapor?,daenerys targaryen
We cannot stay here.,jorah mormont
They have my dragons. A mother does not flee without her children.,daenerys targaryen
"They're not your children. I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them, but you didn't grow them in your womb. They didn't suckle at your breast. They are dragons, Khaleesi. And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die.",jorah mormont
You should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there.,daenerys targaryen
"You know I would die for you. I will never abandon you. I'm sworn to protect you, to serve.",jorah mormont
"Then serve me. If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there.",daenerys targaryen
"That's what the warlock wants. He told you so himself. If you enter that place, you will never leave again. His magic is strong.",jorah mormont
And what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire. You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me? Do you remember?,daenerys targaryen
"Until my last breath, I will remember. After I have forgotten my mother's face.",jorah mormont
They are my children. And they are the only children I will ever have. Take me to them.,daenerys targaryen
We should bury them.,theon greyjoy
"If they haven't got the damn message yet, a few more days won't help. As you say. But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer.",theon greyjoy
Gold for the farmer. For his trouble.,theon greyjoy
"Aye, but we have the wind. She'll blow us straight to the gates.",davos
King's Landing hasn't been home for twenty years. I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet. And now I'm sailing right at them.,davos
"Of course, there are several royal fleets at the moment.",davos
Gods be good.,davos
But not over them?,davos
"Well, first, we have to put it there.",davos
"Our army outnumber theirs five-to-one. Those walls have never been breached, and the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they don't see a liberator, they see a stranger come to set their city on fire.",davos
"If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid.",tyrion lannister
I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. But it's not your war.,tyrion lannister
You can't fuck your way out of everything.,tyrion lannister
Your words are always wise and measured.,cersei lannister
You brought me something?,cersei lannister
I know what ten drops will bring.,cersei lannister
You may not. You must have a lot of work to do. I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.,cersei lannister
"Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester. There are so many.",cersei lannister
To the boys!,bronn
Drunk Lannisters.,bronn
Thank you very much.,bronn
"Well, now let's see. First time, I was five. My mam smacked me with an iron poker.",bronn
It wasn't me she was aiming at. She was trying for my little brother. Now he was a real pest.,bronn
"Second time, I was nine. Got in a scrap with a few older boys. They won. Third time-",bronn
"Eh, you don't want to know about the third time.",bronn
Don't feel sorry for him. He'll be halfway up your arse before the night's through.,bronn
"Welcome, friends. This roundo s on me.",bronn
I don't think he likes me.,bronn
I know it.,bronn
It's warm in here. We've got beautiful women and good brown ale. Plenty for everyone. And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company.,bronn
And quicker. Eh?,bronn
Aye I expect he will someday.,bronn
One more drink before the war? Shall we?,bronn
"I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror. A dead king, a city under siege.",varys
A wedding.,tyrion lannister
"Exactly. Podrick, is that it?",varys
"Is that it?"" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town.",tyrion lannister
I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.,varys
I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.,tyrion lannister
Do you trust him?,varys
"Oddly enough, I do.",tyrion lannister
Good.,varys
The map you asked for.,varys
There must be twenty miles of tunnels beneath the city.,tyrion lannister
Closer to fifty. The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary.,varys
"I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her.",tyrion lannister
"That is good to hear. Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat. You look well suited for battle, my lord.",varys
"Well, I'm not.",tyrion lannister
"For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong. My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from Asshai.",varys
What of it?,tyrion lannister
"You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?",varys
"Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think?",tyrion lannister
I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me.,varys
"Mmm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself.",tyrion lannister
"And yet I have seen things and heard things, things you have not, things I wish I had not. I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut.",varys
"No, I don't believe you have.",tyrion lannister
"One day, I will. The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse. And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him.",varys
I've never known bells to mean surrender. They want to play music with us? Let's play. Drums.,davos
"Remember, wait till the ships-",tyrion lannister
The ships are in the bay.,bronn
They must be far enough in-,tyrion lannister
"I know what ""in"" means. Do you know how to use that?",bronn
"I chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother chopping wood.",tyrion lannister
I saw you kill a man with a shield. You'll be unstoppable with an ax.,bronn
Don't get killed.,bronn
"Nor you, my friend.",tyrion lannister
"Oh, are we friends now?",bronn
Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.,tyrion lannister
"Enhances it, really.",bronn
"Oh! ""Enhances."" Fancy word for a sellsword.",tyrion lannister
Been spending time with fancy folks.,bronn
Lady Sansa and Sheila.,tyrion lannister
"Shae, yes. Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast.",tyrion lannister
"She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off.",sansa stark
"Always been a great romantic, my nephew.",tyrion lannister
"I will pray for your safe return, my lord.",sansa stark
Will you?,tyrion lannister
Just as I pray for the king's.,sansa stark
"Stay safe, my lady.",tyrion lannister
Will you slay him yourself?,sansa stark
So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard?,sansa stark
"I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid. Of course you'll be in the vanguard. They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest. And he is only a pretender.",sansa stark
Joffrey will. The worst ones always live.,sansa stark
On the way.,tyrion lannister
"Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy.",tyrion lannister
"That would make me the quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet.",tyrion lannister
Where are their ships?,davos
Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago. There are no surprises here.,davos
Maybe.,davos
I don't know why she wants me here. She's always saying how stupid I am. She hates me.,sansa stark
I doubt it.,sansa stark
Why would she be jealous?,sansa stark
Sansa.,cersei lannister
"I was wondering where our little dove had flown. You look pale, child. Is your red flower still blooming?",cersei lannister
Yes.,sansa stark
"Fitting, isn't it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here. Pour Lady Sansa some wine.",cersei lannister
So? I didn't offer you water.,cersei lannister
What's he doing here?,sansa stark
"Ser llyn? He's here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him.",cersei lannister
But we have guards to defend us.,sansa stark
"Guards we have paid. Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors.",cersei lannister
The battle's first traitors. Have Ser llyn see to them. Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.,cersei lannister
The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy. Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen.,cersei lannister
You said he was here to protect us.,sansa stark
He is. Traitors are a danger to us all. More wine.,cersei lannister
Archers to their marks.,tyrion lannister
Hold fast.,tyrion lannister
"Archers, stand to! Man the below! Nock.",davos
Draw! Hold.,davos
There's no one on board.,davos
Wildfire. Steer clear! Steer clear!,davos
Matthos! Get down!,davos
Prepare to land.,stannis baratheon
The dwarf has played his little trick.,stannis baratheon
He can only play it once.,stannis baratheon
Thousands.,stannis baratheon
Come with me and take this city!,stannis baratheon
"Sansa, come here, little dove.",cersei lannister
My queen.,sansa stark
What are you doing?,cersei lannister
Praying.,sansa stark
"You're perfect, aren't you? Praying. What are you praying for?",cersei lannister
For the gods to have mercy on us all.,sansa stark
Oh. On all of us?,cersei lannister
"Yes, Your Grace.",sansa stark
Even me?,cersei lannister
"Of course, Your Grace.",sansa stark
Even Joffrey?,cersei lannister
Joffrey is my-,sansa stark
"Oh, shut up, you little fool. Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all. The gods have no mercy. That's why they're gods. My father told me that when he caught me praying. My mother had just died, you see. I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it. I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the gods would return my mother to me. I was four.",cersei lannister
Your father doesn't believe in the gods?,sansa stark
"He believes in them, he just doesn't like them very much.",cersei lannister
One for her.,cersei lannister
Here. Sit. Drink.,cersei lannister
"Not like that. Drink, girl.",cersei lannister
I should have been born a man. I'd rather face a thousand swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens.,cersei lannister
They are your guests under your protection. You asked them here.,sansa stark
"It was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey's queen. If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits.",cersei lannister
And if the city should fall?,sansa stark
"You'd like that, wouldn't you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person. If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon. I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse.",cersei lannister
"Have I shocked you, little dove? Tears aren't a woman's only weapon. The best one's between your legs. Learn how to use it. Drink.",cersei lannister
"Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked? No, you wouldn't, would you? If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape. Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning. You'll be glad of your red flower then. When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good. A precious thing like you will look very, very good. A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten.",cersei lannister
"He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon.",tyrion lannister
Rain fire on them.,tyrion lannister
"Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground. Pod, run to the King's Gate. Bring any men guarding it here, now.",tyrion lannister
"To the Mud Gate, go now!",stannis baratheon
"When we were young, Jaime and I, we looked so much alike even our father couldn't tell us apart. I could never understand why they treated us differently. Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace, and I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to Casterly Rock, and I was sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired.",cersei lannister
You were Robert's queen.,sansa stark
And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy. I don't think I know this one.,cersei lannister
Pretty.,cersei lannister
"That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen. Here, it's not difficult. I mastered it when I was four. Straighten your back and bend.",cersei lannister
Better. You learn fast. How long have you been in Lady Sansa's service?,cersei lannister
When did you leave Lorath?,cersei lannister
I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.,cersei lannister
But she was a nobleman's daughter. You're not. When did you come to Westeros?,cersei lannister
"From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in ten years, all without learning how to curtsy. I imagine that's a very interesting story. What's your name?",cersei lannister
"Tell us a story, Shae.",cersei lannister
What news?,cersei lannister
Where is Joffrey?,cersei lannister
Bring him back inside at once.,cersei lannister
What?,cersei lannister
Bring him back to his chambers now.,cersei lannister
With the women and children? Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life?,cersei lannister
Now!,cersei lannister
"When I told you about Ser llyn earlier, I lied. Do you want to hear the truth? You want to know why he's really here? He's here for us. Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne, but he will not take us alive.",cersei lannister
Get the ladders up!,stannis baratheon
"Can I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?",tyrion lannister
You're on the wrong side of the wall.,tyrion lannister
"You're Kingsguard, Clegane. You must beat them back or they're going to take this city. Your king's city.",tyrion lannister
"If you won't defend your own city, why should they?",tyrion lannister
Lead. Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them.,tyrion lannister
I'll lead the attack. I'll lead the attack!,tyrion lannister
"Pod, my helmet. Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner. Men, form up. Men Men! They say I'm half a man. But what does that make the lot of you?",tyrion lannister
There's another way out. I'm going to show you. We'll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses.,tyrion lannister
"Don't fight for your king and don't fight for his kingdoms. Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory. Don't fight for riches, because you won't get any. This is your city Stannis means to sack. That's your gate he's ramming. If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he will rape.",tyrion lannister
Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them.,tyrion lannister
Where is my son?,cersei lannister
Why do I care what you want? Bring me-,cersei lannister
"Don't be afraid. The queen has raised the drawbridge. This is the safest place we can be. Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely. His knights have rallied behind him. They will save the city. Shall we sing a hymn? Gentle mother, fount of mercy...",sansa stark
Come with me.,sansa stark
The queen said they'd rape everyone.,sansa stark
What are you doing here?,sansa stark
Where?,sansa stark
What about the king?,sansa stark
I'll be safe here. Stannis won't hurt me.,sansa stark
You won't hurt me.,sansa stark
Attack!,tyrion lannister
"Oh, fuck me.",tyrion lannister
"Shh! Be calm, my sweet.",cersei lannister
No one's going to hurt you. I'll tell you a story. You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub? They lived in the woods.,cersei lannister
"Yes, my love. In the Kingswood, there lived a mother and her cub. She loved him very much. But there were other things that lived in the woods. Evil things.",cersei lannister
Like stags.,cersei lannister
And wolves.,cersei lannister
"He could hear them howling in the night. The little cub was frightened. His mother said, ""You are a lion, my son. You mustn't be afraid.""",cersei lannister
"For one day, all the beasts will bow to you. You will be king. All the stags will bow. All the wolves will bow. The bears in the north and the foxes of the south, all the birds in the sky and the beasts in the sea, they will all come to you, little lion, to rest a crown upon your head.",cersei lannister
"And the cub said, ""Will I be strong and fierce like my father?""",cersei lannister
"Yes,"" said his mother. ""You will be strong and fierce just like your father.",cersei lannister
"I will keep you safe, my love. I promise you.",cersei lannister
"Stand and fight! Stand and fight, damn you!",stannis baratheon
No!,stannis baratheon
Father.,cersei lannister
The battle is over. We have won.,tywin lannister
Pod.,tyrion lannister
Pod! Find Bronn or Varys. Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle. Tell them I am very much alive.,tyrion lannister
What happened?,tyrion lannister
Where am I?,tyrion lannister
"Thank you, Your Grace.",tywin lannister
"You honor me beyond words, Your Grace. I shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons.",petyr baelish
"Your Grace, in the judgment of your Small Council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne as we speak. For the good of the realm, your councilors beg you to set Sansa Stark aside.",cersei lannister
My lady. My sincerest condolences.,petyr baelish
They're right. I'm not good enough for him.,sansa stark
"You shouldn't say that. You'll be good enough for many things. He'll still enjoy beating you. And now that you're a woman, he'll be able to enjoy you in other ways as well.",petyr baelish
"But, if he's not marrying me-",sansa stark
"He'll let you go home? Joffrey's not the sort of boy who gives away his toys. You have a tender heart, just like your mother did at your age. I can see so much of her in you. She was like a sister to me. For her sake, I'll help get you home.",petyr baelish
King's Landing is my home now.,sansa stark
Look around you. We're all liars here. And every one of us is better than you.,petyr baelish
"No need for that, my dear.",varys
I'm not like most men.,varys
I would like you to tell me if working for Lord Baelish has been all you'd hoped it would be.,varys
You wouldn't remember me if we had?,varys
And I think you remember all of them. I think your true talents are wasted on them.,varys
You're afraid. Why? Nothing dangerous down there.,varys
"And, unlike your current employer, I protect those who work for me. I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims or force them to abuse each other.",varys
I thought you said you knew who I was.,varys
Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes. I see a potential partner.,varys
"Oh, you should be. He's a dangerous man. But everyone has their weaknesses. Your current employer hides his very well, but not as well as he thinks.",varys
"You're a virgin, I take it?",jaime lannister
Walk.,brienne
"Childhood must have been awful for you. Were you a foot taller than all the boys? They laughed at you, called you names? Some boys like a challenge. One or two must have tried to get inside Big Brienne.",jaime lannister
One or two tried.,brienne
"Ah. But you fought them off. But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes. But none of them were strong enough. I'm strong enough.",jaime lannister
Not interested.,brienne
Of course you are. You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman.,jaime lannister
"Ah. ""They lay with lions."" Tavern girls, I'd say. Probably served my father's soldiers. Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel. That's how they earned this. The glorious work of the Northern freedom fighters. Must make you proud to serve the Starks.",jaime lannister
I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn.,brienne
Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams.,jaime lannister
What are you doing?,jaime lannister
Burying them.,brienne
We shouldn't stay here. We should get back on the river.,jaime lannister
I think these women would understand if I don't care what you think.,brienne
Untie me. Now!,jaime lannister
Traveling a prisoner.,brienne
If you've quite finished up-,brienne
"All right, we'll be going.",brienne
The Starks.,brienne
Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?,jaime lannister
"No, stealing is a crime.",brienne
But it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you.,jaime lannister
To Riverrun.,brienne
"Steal from the Tullys, it's their dungeons you rot in.",brienne
For stealing a pig?,jaime lannister
I don't give the orders. He must be important to someone.,brienne
Have you been to Ashemark?,jaime lannister
Then you don't know me.,jaime lannister
Is it near Ashemark?,jaime lannister
I've never been there.,jaime lannister
I hope you gave them quick deaths.,brienne
I wish someone had told me. I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.,jaime lannister
"If this is the Kingslayer, I think I'd know about it.",brienne
"He's not the Kingslayer. Sorry to disappoint you. If he was, I'd only be traveling his head.",brienne
Two quick deaths.,brienne
Those were Stark men.,jaime lannister
"I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn. I told you I'd take you to King's Landing, and that's what I'm going to do. Stay.",brienne
Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.,catelyn stark
I know that.,robb stark
And you mean to do it anyway?,catelyn stark
I love her.,robb stark
I know that seems important to you.,catelyn stark
It is important to me.,robb stark
"Your father didn't love me when we married. He hardly knew me or I him. Love didn't just happen to us. We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us. It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger. It lasts longer.",catelyn stark
"And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters, what you and father had?",robb stark
Why not? Because she's not beautiful? Because she's not exotic and exciting?,catelyn stark
Now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it.,robb stark
"And you agreed to it. You gave him your word. Treat your oaths recklessly, and your people will do the same. If your father lived his life for one thing",catelyn stark
My father is dead. And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless.,robb stark
You said you saw my victory in the flames.,stannis baratheon
"The flames lied. And I'm no better than a savage trusting in a fire god. I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay. I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what? Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells. If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me?",stannis baratheon
You claimed to speak for a god.,stannis baratheon
You talk about war as if you understand it.,stannis baratheon
Have you? Show me how you fight.,stannis baratheon
Show me.,stannis baratheon
Where's your god now? Will he save you? Where is your god?,stannis baratheon
I murdered my brother.,stannis baratheon
He wasn't your brother.,stannis baratheon
"You promise these things, but you don't know. None of us know.",stannis baratheon
I see fire.,stannis baratheon
Yes.,stannis baratheon
"I will kill that man. I don't care how many arrows they feather me with, how many spears they run through me, I will kill that horn-blowing cunt before I fall.",theon greyjoy
I know I'm surrounded. I know that because I stood on the battlements and saw I was surrounded.,theon greyjoy
"Thank you, wise bald man. Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me.",theon greyjoy
No word from my father?,theon greyjoy
Send more ravens.,theon greyjoy
The first time I saw Winterfell-,theon greyjoy
"First time I saw Winterfell, it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead. I saw it and I thought, ""Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers. ""We never stood a chance against the man who lives here.""",theon greyjoy
"Yes, my captors were so very kind to me. You love reminding me of that. Everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me of that. You know what it's like to be told how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner? To be told how much you owe them? And then to go back home to your real father",theon greyjoy
"I will kill that man. I swear to the Drowned God, the Old Gods, the New Gods, to every fucking god in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man.",theon greyjoy
"And what's your counsel, trusted friend?",theon greyjoy
"There's nowhere to run. I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands. And even if I did, even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home, I'd be a coward. The Greyjoy who ran. The shame of the family.",theon greyjoy
I won't make it to the Wall. I won't make it ten feet past the Winterfell gates.,theon greyjoy
The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep.,theon greyjoy
"I've done a lot, haven't I? Things I never imagined myself doing.",theon greyjoy
You may be right. But I've gone too far to pretend to be anything else.,theon greyjoy
"You hear that? That's the mating call of the Northmen. They want to fuck us. Well, I haven't had a good fuck in weeks. I'm ready for one.",theon greyjoy
They say every Ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland.,theon greyjoy
You think they're right?,theon greyjoy
"We die today, brothers. We die bleeding from a hundred wounds with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts, but our war cries will echo through eternity. They will sing about the battle of Winterfell until the Iron Islands have slipped beneath the waves. Every man, woman and child will know who we were and how long we stood. Aggar and Gelmarr, Wex and Urzen, Stygg and Black Lorren. Ironborn warriors will cry out our names as they leap onto the shores of Seagard and Faircastle.",theon greyjoy
Mothers will name their sons for us.,theon greyjoy
Girls will think of us with their lovers inside them.,theon greyjoy
And whoever kills that fucking horn-blower will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke!,theon greyjoy
What is dead may never die!,theon greyjoy
Why should I believe you?,tyrion lannister
Why would I lie about it?,varys
To create strife between my sister and me.,tyrion lannister
"Where before there was nothing but love. Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sister's orders. If it weren't for your squire's bravery, you'd be a dead man.",varys
Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?,tyrion lannister
"You're a good lad. Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times.",tyrion lannister
I'm afraid your friend has been relieved of his command of the City Watch. The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father or your sister. It varies from cloak to cloak.,varys
Then my hill tribesmen.,tyrion lannister
"Have gone home. Your father paid them quite handsomely. I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other for some time, my lord.",varys
Don't want to swim too close to a drowning man? And I thought we were friends.,tyrion lannister
"We are. Podrick, would you mind?",varys
"There are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat. The king won't give you any honors, the histories won't mention you, but we will not forget.",varys
"Come along now, Podrick.",varys
It was good of you to come.,tyrion lannister
"Believe me, you don't.",tyrion lannister
Well?,tyrion lannister
I'm a monster as well as a dwarf. You should charge me double.,tyrion lannister
That was the arrangement we made. I pay you and you lie to me.,tyrion lannister
Leave?,tyrion lannister
What would we do in Pentos?,tyrion lannister
I want to go with you.,tyrion lannister
"I can't. I do belong here. These bad people are what I'm good at. Out-talking them, out-thinking them. It's what I am. And I like it. I like it more than anything I've ever done. Are you going to leave?",tyrion lannister
"Father, smith, warrior, mother ,maiden, crone, stranger.",robb stark
I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days.,robb stark
"No guards. The warlocks kill with sorcery, not steel.",jorah mormont
Let them try.,daenerys targaryen
Is this a riddle?,daenerys targaryen
Khaleesi! Khaleesi!,jorah mormont
Are you trying to frighten me with magic tricks? You want me? Here I am. Are you afraid of a little girl?,daenerys targaryen
What are you doing here?,arya stark
How did you know we'd come this way?,arya stark
How did you kill those guards? Was it hard?,arya stark
"Show me how. I want to be able to do it, too.",arya stark
Where?,arya stark
My dancing master was from Braavos.,arya stark
"I want to. But I can't. I need to find my brother and mother. And my sister. I need to find her, too.",arya stark
What is it?,arya stark
Could it buy a horse?,arya stark
Then what good is it?,arya stark
Valar Morghulis.,arya stark
"Please don't go, Jaqen.",arya stark
"This is dark magic, like the magic that took you from me. Took you from me before I could even Maybe I am dead and I just don't know it yet. Maybe I am with you in the Night Lands.",daenerys targaryen
That sounds like something you would do.,daenerys targaryen
"Until the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, until the rivers run dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.",daenerys targaryen
"This is not my home. My home is across the sea, where my people are waiting for me.",daenerys targaryen
Dracarys.,daenerys targaryen
Careful with that. You might cut yourself.,jon snow
"Never swung a sword before, have you? You look like a baby with a rattle.",jon snow
Stop!,jon snow
Come.,daenerys targaryen
Nothing.,daenerys targaryen
"Thank you, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. Thank you for teaching me this lesson.",daenerys targaryen
It's all a lie.,jorah mormont
Looks real enough to me. Real enough to buy a ship?,daenerys targaryen
"Aye, a small ship.",jorah mormont
Take all the gold and jewels.,jorah mormont
"If you step back and think about it, the thing about Gilly that's so interesting is",sam
"No, truly. The thing about her that I find so interesting is that after all that Craster's done to her, she's still got hope that life might get better.",sam
And the thing about you that I find so interesting is absolutely nothing.,sam
It's Jon and the Halfhand. They're back.,sam
Wait! Wait for me!,sam
Grenn!,sam
Edd!,sam
Brother?,sam
Mance was a ranger.,jon snow
"When I'm free, will I be free to go?",jon snow
What happened to their fathers?,jon snow
My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.,jon snow
Jon Snow.,jon snow
Your Grace.,jon snow
The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.,jon snow
He wants me to lead one day.,jon snow
"If I'm a traitor, then you are, too.",jon snow
I want to be free.,jon snow
We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north. I saw...,jon snow
I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it.,jon snow
"Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place?",jon snow
What if you took off that bit there?,bronn
"Trouble is, I've never had much imagination.",bronn
I didn't hear that.,bronn
Back away. Keep backing away till you're outside this establishment. Then back away some more.,bronn
"I will murder you, boy.",bronn
Pod?,tyrion lannister
It's your sister. The queen.,cersei lannister
What are they doing here?,tyrion lannister
"Protecting me, I assume. Will you let me in?",cersei lannister
"No, I don't think so.",tyrion lannister
"If I wanted to kill you, do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me?",cersei lannister
They stay outside.,tyrion lannister
"I'm not afraid of you, little brother.",cersei lannister
Why are you here?,tyrion lannister
"I wanted to see your face. They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that.",cersei lannister
The man who cut me lost more than his nose.,tyrion lannister
"I should hope so. The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own. Thanks to Father.",cersei lannister
"Thanks to Father. Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me.",tyrion lannister
No? Curious. Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand. But then I don't suppose you need much room.,cersei lannister
Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke. You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.,tyrion lannister
You're meeting Father today?,cersei lannister
How do you know that?,tyrion lannister
Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ. The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two. Father told me. What do you want from him?,cersei lannister
"What do I want from him? He's my father. Do I need to want something? I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy. Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing. I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came.",tyrion lannister
You're going to make me cry.,cersei lannister
Why do you care what I want from him?,tyrion lannister
Because you've slandered me to Father before.,cersei lannister
Slandered? When?,tyrion lannister
You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.,cersei lannister
"You did have your guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe.",tyrion lannister
"I was nine, too.",cersei lannister
"She lost an eye, if I remember correctly.",tyrion lannister
"If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again.",cersei lannister
It's not slander if it's true.,tyrion lannister
And what's this truth you plan on telling him today?,cersei lannister
Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father?,tyrion lannister
"Because you're a liar. I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey.",cersei lannister
Any lies in particular?,tyrion lannister
"You're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are.",cersei lannister
Still makes me more clever than you.,tyrion lannister
"Oh, look at these two shining warriors. Ser Taryn Mant and... Ser Whosit of Whocares.",bronn
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.,bronn
Pod.,bronn
"That's exactly who I am. And you're a grub in fancy armor who's better at beating little girls than fighting men. Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion.",bronn
"As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship, I am wondering why you sent for me.",bronn
A number of people in this city want to kill me. You're here to protect me.,tyrion lannister
I've been doing that for a while now.,bronn
Do you grow bored protecting me?,tyrion lannister
I grow poor protecting you.,bronn
"Poor? Poor? Under my patronage you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch.",tyrion lannister
Briefly.,bronn
I'm sure you filled your pockets.,tyrion lannister
"And now my pockets are empty. You've given me a taste for the finer things. And if you want me to carry on protecting you, you'll need to pay more.",bronn
I thought we were friends.,tyrion lannister
We are. But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword. I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.,bronn
How much?,tyrion lannister
Double.,bronn
Double?,tyrion lannister
I'm a knight now. Knights are worth double.,bronn
I don't even know how much I'm paying you now.,tyrion lannister
Which means you can afford it.,bronn
Here. Here! Help me!,davos
I was in the battle at Blackwater. I was a captain and a knight.,davos
The one true king of Westeros... Stannis Baratheon.,davos
"No, the wildfire took him. I saw it.",davos
"If I was a good father, he'd still be here. Stannis lives?",davos
Will you take me there?,davos
This war is not over.,davos
We're both sworn to King Stannis.,davos
Stannis never gives up. Never. Now he will regroup ...,davos
What?,davos
You're a smuggler.,davos
"Take me back there, please.",davos
"Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out.",davos
You call me friend. You drank with me on my wedding day.,davos
"I have to stop her. Please, do this for me.",davos
There won't be a siege. The Mountain can't defend a ruin.,robb stark
The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross. I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight. I don't think we're going to get one.,robb stark
A Mallister?,robb stark
Ser Jeremy. My father's bannerman.,catelyn stark
Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell.,robb stark
She freed Jaime Lannister. The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice.,robb stark
"What's your name, friend?",robb stark
The badge looks good on you. Almost as good as it looked on me. Are you enjoying your new position?,tyrion lannister
Am I enjoying it?,tywin lannister
I was very happy as Hand of the King.,tyrion lannister
Yes. I heard how happy you were.,tywin lannister
blows on his paper to dry the ink.,tywin lannister
You brought a whore into my bed.,tywin lannister
It wasn't your bed at the time.,tyrion lannister
"I sent you here to advise the king. I gave you real power and authority. You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves.",tywin lannister
Occasionally I drank with the harlots.,tyrion lannister
"What do you want, Tyrion?",tywin lannister
Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.,tyrion lannister
Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.,tywin lannister
"I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal. I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family. And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell. But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start.",tyrion lannister
"Jugglers and singers require applause. You are a Lannister. Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion. So tell me what you want.",tywin lannister
"I want what is mine by right. Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles. But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance. The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock. I am your son and lawful heir.",tyrion lannister
You want Casterly Rock?,tywin lannister
It is mine by right.,tyrion lannister
"We'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay. And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy. And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife. And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock.",tywin lannister
Why?,tyrion lannister
"Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go.",tywin lannister
"Oh, one more thing. The next whore I catch in your bed, I'll hang.",tywin lannister
Dorne. It's going to Dorne.,sansa stark
It's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange. But it's not coming back. The captain's tired of risking his life so King's Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve. He's going to stay in Dorne. Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm.,sansa stark
Don't ruin the game.,sansa stark
What about that one there?,sansa stark
Why?,sansa stark
That's not how the game works. You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer. You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.,sansa stark
Because the truth is always either terrible or boring.,sansa stark
Lovely day for it. Watching the ships.,petyr baelish
Lord Baelish.,sansa stark
Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?,petyr baelish
I saw your mother not long ago. She's very eager to see you. And your sister.,petyr baelish
Arya's alive? You said you'd take me home.,sansa stark
You said King's Landing was your home. You are the property of the crown. Stealing you would be treason. If you were to tell just one person ...,petyr baelish
I won't tell anyone.,sansa stark
How do I know?,petyr baelish
"Because I'm a terrible liar. You said so yourself. Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when.",sansa stark
"I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital. When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me. But you'll need to be ready to leave on a moment's notice.",petyr baelish
They're growing fast.,jorah mormont
Not fast enough. I can't wait that long. I need an army,daenerys targaryen
We'll be in Astapor by nightfall. Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world.,jorah mormont
The greatest slave-soldiers in the world. The distinction means a good deal to some people.,daenerys targaryen
Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne?,jorah mormont
It's too beautiful a day to argue.,daenerys targaryen
You're right. Another lovely day on the high seas.,jorah mormont
"Don't mock them. They're the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship. They followed me across the poison water. If they'll do it, others will. And with a true khalasar ...",daenerys targaryen
"The Dothraki follow strength above all, khaleesi. You'll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong. And not before.",jorah mormont
Your Grace.,davos
I heard you were dead.,stannis baratheon
Not yet.,davos
"I had hoped to speak to you alone, Your Grace.",stannis baratheon
We are alone.,stannis baratheon
"Your Grace, you are the rightful king. Not only by blood. You're an honorable man, a just man. And there is still a war to fight.",davos
I am fighting.,stannis baratheon
By burning prisoners alive?,davos
"I do not judge people for the gods they worship. If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone.",davos
You are my enemy.,davos
This woman is evil! She's the mother of demons.,davos
Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell.,stannis baratheon
Your Grace!,davos
She will destroy us all!,davos
"Yes, it suits you perfectly. I imagine you might be rather cold.",cersei lannister
You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen. Perhaps before. Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning.,cersei lannister
"An open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom if you're not careful, my dear. Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there. We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them. The king barely escaped with his life.",cersei lannister
"You're right, of course. But you are your father's son. We can't all have a king's bravery.",cersei lannister
I'm sure she does.,cersei lannister
They may suit my needs. Tell me of their training.,daenerys targaryen
Even the bravest men fear death.,jorah mormont
Tell the good master there is no need.,daenerys targaryen
"You take a babe from its mother's arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?",daenerys targaryen
How many do you have to sell?,daenerys targaryen
Eight thousand dead babies.,daenerys targaryen
The Unsullied are a means to an end.,jorah mormont
"Once I own them, these men...",daenerys targaryen
They're not men. Not anymore.,jorah mormont
"Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be?",daenerys targaryen
Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you?,jorah mormont
You'll be fair to them. You won't mutilate them to make a point.,jorah mormont
You won't order them to murder babies. You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered. A great injustice has been done to them. Closing your eyes will not undo it.,jorah mormont
The warlocks.,daenerys targaryen
"I owe you my life, Ser.",daenerys targaryen
You know this man?,daenerys targaryen
I know him as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen and as the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard.,jorah mormont
"Don't think too much, Bran.",jon snow
Relax your bow arm.,jon snow
Did you ever think you'd marry one?,robb stark
Never?,robb stark
Let me guess which one is the good news.,robb stark
I hadn't seen him in years. I don't even know how many.,catelyn stark
We'll travel to the funeral together. Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.,robb stark
Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest?,catelyn stark
Something else?,catelyn stark
"By the time Bolton's bastard Ramsay got to Winterfell, the Ironborn were gone. They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch. And Bran and Rickon have not been found. They may have escaped. Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages.",robb stark
Have you received any demands?,catelyn stark
No.,robb stark
Have you heard anything from Theon at all?,catelyn stark
Where am I? Who are you? What do you want?,theon greyjoy
Do you know how long it's going to take us to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests?,jaime lannister
Yes.,brienne
So how shall we pass the time?,jaime lannister
By putting one foot in front of the other.,brienne
It's going to be a very dull walk.,jaime lannister
I'm here to take you to King's Landing and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange. Dull is fine.,brienne
"You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute. Trust me on this. People have been serving me since I was born. You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword.",jaime lannister
"If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I'm sure she'll let me know. She's an honest woman.",brienne
All the good it's done her.,jaime lannister
How did you come into Lady Stark's service? There's something we can talk about.,jaime lannister
"Not your concern, Kingslayer.",brienne
It had to be recently. You weren't with her at Winterfell.,jaime lannister
How would you know?,brienne
Because I visited Winterfell. I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.,jaime lannister
Move.,brienne
Were you pledged to Stannis?,jaime lannister
"Gods, no.",brienne
"Ah, Renly. Really? He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal.",jaime lannister
Shut your mouth.,brienne
"Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget. Could hardly escape the little tulip. Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks. I knew him far better than you.",jaime lannister
"I knew him as well as anyone. As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything. He would have been a wonderful king.",brienne
Sounds like you quite fancied him.,jaime lannister
I did not fancy him.,brienne
"Oh, gods, you did.",jaime lannister
"Did you ever tell him? No, of course not. You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid.",jaime lannister
He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell. You're far too much man for him.,jaime lannister
I'm not interested in foul rumors.,brienne
Unless they're about me. It's all true about Renly. His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court. It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks. They'd have never got him off it.,jaime lannister
Shut your mouth!,brienne
"I don't blame him. And I don't blame you, either. We don't get to choose who we love.",jaime lannister
South. You?,brienne
"No, you really can't.",jaime lannister
And you.,brienne
He knows who I am.,jaime lannister
He doesn't.,brienne
Maybe you're right. But what if you're not? What if he tells someone?,jaime lannister
We're not doing it. He's an innocent man.,brienne
More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?,jaime lannister
That's better. It makes you look very strong.,cersei lannister
Looks like a Tyrell rose. Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown. Should be more than enough fabric.,cersei lannister
Tell me what you think of her.,cersei lannister
Margaery.,cersei lannister
"It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent.",cersei lannister
Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting.,cersei lannister
I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself.,cersei lannister
Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason. She dresses like a harlot for a reason. She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.,cersei lannister
You need to ask yourself,cersei lannister
He didn't. He didn't want anything. He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.,sansa stark
Littlefinger's not in love with me.,sansa stark
He's too old.,sansa stark
No.,sansa stark
Why? What will you do? I will make him stop.,sansa stark
Send him in.,sansa stark
Ser Loras.,sansa stark
"You are too kind, Ser Loras. You probably don't remember the first time we met. At the Hando s tourney, you gave me your favor. A rose, a red rose.",sansa stark
"Thank you, Ser Loras.",sansa stark
"Kiss me, child.",olenna tyrell
It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens. We're very sorry for your losses.,olenna tyrell
"And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery. He was very gallant.",sansa stark
"Gallant, yes. And charming and very clean. He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king.",olenna tyrell
Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick. That does not make him wise. As to your fathead father-,olenna tyrell
"She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate. It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother. How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me. But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders. So here we are to see things through. What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes?",olenna tyrell
Lemon cake's my favorite.,sansa stark
"So we've been told. Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me. I'm much less boring than these others.",olenna tyrell
Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden?,olenna tyrell
I haven't had the pleasure.,sansa stark
"No great pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf. His father was an oaf as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him. And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse. Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey.",olenna tyrell
"I-, I-",sansa stark
"You, you. Who else would know better? We've heard some troubling tales. Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you?",olenna tyrell
Has he ripped out your tongue?,olenna tyrell
"Joff-King Joffrey, he-His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion",sansa stark
"Yes, all Lannisters are lions. And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose. But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?",olenna tyrell
Bring me some cheese.,olenna tyrell
The cheese will be served when I want it served. And I want it served now.,olenna tyrell
"Are you frightened, child? No need for that. We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you.",olenna tyrell
My father always told the truth.,sansa stark
"Yes, he had that reputation. And they named him traitor and took his head.",olenna tyrell
Joffrey. Joffrey did that. He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off. And he said that was mercy. Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.,sansa stark
Go on.,olenna tyrell
I-I can't. I never meant-my father was a traitor. My brother as well. I have traitor's blood. Please don't make me say anymore.,sansa stark
"Speak freely, child. We would never betray your confidence, I swear it.",olenna tyrell
He's a monster.,sansa stark
Ah. That's a pity.,olenna tyrell
"Please, don't stop the wedding.",sansa stark
"Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen. Even so, we thank you for the truth. Ah, here comes my cheese.",olenna tyrell
My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.,robb stark
My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there. We need his men.,robb stark
Have you lost faith in our cause?,robb stark
If you no longer believe-,robb stark
You don't think we can win?,robb stark
"Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?",robb stark
You're afraid of her. And she knows it.,catelyn stark
No.,catelyn stark
You can't help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them. Only a mother can make them.,catelyn stark
Twice.,catelyn stark
After a fashion. I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.,catelyn stark
"Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox. Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live. But it would be a very long night. So I sat with him all through the darkness. Listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering.",catelyn stark
"Jon Snow. When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him. I didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring up at me. So I prayed to the gods, take him away. Make him die. He got the pox. And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived. A murderer. I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother. A woman he didn't even know. So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us.",catelyn stark
And he lived. And I couldn't keep my promise. And everything that's happened since then all this horror that's come to my family it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child.,catelyn stark
Yes.,jon snow
I understand.,jon snow
You want to protect your people.,jon snow
No.,jon snow
What's wrong with him?,jon snow
No.,sam
I can't.,sam
You don't care.,sam
"You left me. When the white walkers came, you left me.",sam
Would you please shut up about it?,arya stark
I'm not listening.,arya stark
Shut up.,arya stark
"Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining?",arya stark
Where are we going?,arya stark
"If we were going north, we should have come to the Red Fork River by now.",arya stark
"It's a hundred feet wide. How could we have passed it? If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun. My mother grew up there. My grandfather, he's a lord. He'll protect us.",arya stark
Shh.,arya stark
Don't.,arya stark
You go on down the road. Just keep on singing so we know where you are. Leave us be and I won't kill you.,arya stark
What friends?,arya stark
Who are you?,arya stark
"No, who do you fight for?",arya stark
We've spoken of this. You cannot come here.,tyrion lannister
Did anyone see you? No.,tyrion lannister
You sure? My father does not make idle threats. Having you killed would be the high point of his week. You have to be absolutely certain.,tyrion lannister
All right. What is this problem?,tyrion lannister
Baelish doesn't have friends.,tyrion lannister
"Oh, Ros? The redhead?",tyrion lannister
I try to know as many people as I can. You never know which one you'll need.,tyrion lannister
"Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things.",tyrion lannister
"Oh, please. All right, yes, I fucked her once. Twice.",tyrion lannister
"But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else.",tyrion lannister
"Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger?",tyrion lannister
Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?,tyrion lannister
"We can't. Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old name.",tyrion lannister
"Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you.",tyrion lannister
I don't even want to talk about her.,tyrion lannister
Only because you're making me.,tyrion lannister
This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.,tyrion lannister
"Hmm, yes.",tyrion lannister
Only if you stop. But you mustn't come here again.,tyrion lannister
Do you hear me? You've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people. Dangerous people.,tyrion lannister
Stop! Stop!,theon greyjoy
About what?,theon greyjoy
I don't know what you want.,theon greyjoy
What truth?,theon greyjoy
I took it to-I took it-,theon greyjoy
No one. I took it on my own.,theon greyjoy
To take the North while it was vulnerable.,theon greyjoy
Hold it. Rule it.,theon greyjoy
Why did you do that?,theon greyjoy
I took it to bring glory to my house and my father.,theon greyjoy
"Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I took it because I hated the Starks. I hated them for holding me prisoner. I wanted to hurt them.",theon greyjoy
What are you doing?,theon greyjoy
Please.,theon greyjoy
"I'll tell you anything. Just take it off. Please. Please, just take it off.",theon greyjoy
Yara?,theon greyjoy
"No, don't go. Please, please. No, please don't leave me. Please, please. Please, please don't go! Please. Please. Don't leave me. Please don't go.",theon greyjoy
I don't drink ale.,arya stark
We're not children.,arya stark
Gendry's a smith. He was apprenticed in the armory.,arya stark
Gendry stole us weapons.,arya stark
He knows how to use a sword and so do I.,arya stark
My brothers taught me.,arya stark
You'll free us?,arya stark
It's a tough decision - take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water.,jaime lannister
"Silence, Kingslayer.",brienne
"Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river.",jaime lannister
Good luck.,brienne
It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas. Which will she choose?,jaime lannister
Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed.,jaime lannister
Be quick about it.,brienne
I need to rest.,jaime lannister
Get up.,brienne
"I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far. What do you call them?",jaime lannister
Get up now.,brienne
"Corns. I never used to get corns. Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year.",jaime lannister
This heel is ruined. There's no way-,jaime lannister
I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.,jaime lannister
Ooh. You move well for a great beast of a woman.,jaime lannister
You shouldn't grimace before you lunge. It gives away the game.,jaime lannister
"Bit of a quandary for you. If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark. But if you don't kill me, I'm going to kill you.",jaime lannister
"You're good. Graceless, but good.",jaime lannister
"See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there.",jaime lannister
We enjoy a good fight. Gets our juices flowing. The Flayed Man of House Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste.,jaime lannister
Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.,jaime lannister
It's not about glory. Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.,robb stark
What value was the mill?,robb stark
Is he there now? Of course not.,robb stark
"I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him. I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad without a strategic thought in his head. I could have that head on a spike by now. Instead, I have a mill.",robb stark
Willem and Martyn Lannister are fourteen years old.,robb stark
Tywin Lannister has my sisters. Have I sued for peace?,robb stark
Do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father's brother's great-grandsons?,robb stark
How many men did you lose?,robb stark
We need our men more than Tywin needs his!,robb stark
You would have. Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient.,robb stark
You know who isn't? Tywin Lannister.,robb stark
Intimate. Lovely table. Better chairs than the old small council chamber. Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it.,tyrion lannister
What news of Jaime?,tywin lannister
"Twenty thousand unwashed Northerns have known about his escape for weeks. Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined. Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?",tywin lannister
"We are trying, my lord.",varys
"Try harder. What do we have, then?",tywin lannister
"Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully. In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name.",varys
"Well, let him have it. The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble. The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.",tywin lannister
"For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord. Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children. She has always been positively predisposed toward me.",petyr baelish
Titles do seem to breed titles.,petyr baelish
You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold. Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him.,tywin lannister
"Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems. The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory. Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead. Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended.",tyrion lannister
Fully agreed. Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.,tywin lannister
Master of Coin?,tyrion lannister
It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.,tywin lannister
"I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it.",tyrion lannister
I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge.,cersei lannister
"I hope you're pleased. If you had armed me, they never would have taken us.",jaime lannister
You were armed when we were taken.,brienne
I was in chains if you recall. Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound.,jaime lannister
"All my life I've been hearing, 'Jaime Lannister, what a brilliant swordsman.' You were slower than I expected. And more predictable.",brienne
I've been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year.,jaime lannister
And I'm a woman. I was still beating you.,brienne
You were not beating me.,jaime lannister
Maybe you were as good as people said once. Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name.,brienne
"When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped. More than once. None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman. You'd be wise not to resist.",jaime lannister
Would I?,brienne
They'll knock your teeth out.,jaime lannister
You think I care about my teeth?,brienne
"No, I don't think you care about your teeth. If you fight them, they will kill you. Do you understand? I'm the prisoner of value, not you. Let them have what they want. What does it matter?",jaime lannister
What does it matter?,brienne
Close your eyes. Pretend they're Renly.,jaime lannister
"If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist? You'd let them do what they wanted?",brienne
"If I was a woman, I'd make them kill me. But I'm not, thank the gods.",jaime lannister
Why are you helping him? He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend?,arya stark
What am I?,arya stark
"So I can walk away, then?",arya stark
You remember the last time you were here?,arya stark
What are you doing? We're about to leave.,arya stark
Winterfell.,arya stark
I'm sure.,arya stark
What is it?,arya stark
That's the tail?,arya stark
"Good-bye, Hot Pie.",arya stark
"Hey, Hot Pie. It's really good.",arya stark
A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting we're at war.,catelyn stark
"I've missed you, Uncle. Father missed you, too, from the day you left. Maybe he never said it in so many words-",catelyn stark
I'm glad you were with him. I wish to the gods I had been. Did you make peace in the end?,catelyn stark
"Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign, I'd see him off. 'Wait for me, little Cat,' he'd say. 'Wait for me and I'll come back to you.' And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting. I wonder how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell waiting for me to return. I will never see them again.",catelyn stark
It's only horses. No men.,jon snow
About three hundred.,jon snow
Do you think anyone got away?,jon snow
Ghost?,sam
I can ride.,theon greyjoy
I'll make you a Lord of the Iron Islands for this.,theon greyjoy
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.,theon greyjoy
You refuse to tell me where you're going?,stannis baratheon
How long will you be gone?,stannis baratheon
You're abandoning me.,stannis baratheon
Then serve me.,stannis baratheon
My enemies think they've destroyed me. They're laughing at me the way Renly laughed at me. I want Joffrey dead. I want Robb Stark dead. Make me another son.,stannis baratheon
Why?,stannis baratheon
I'm not so easily killed. Men have been trying for years.,stannis baratheon
I want you.,stannis baratheon
You told me your magic requires a king's blood.,stannis baratheon
I'm the one true king.,stannis baratheon
To whom?,daenerys targaryen
Give me your water.,daenerys targaryen
"Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death.",jorah mormont
"Here, drink.",daenerys targaryen
And what is she to do for soldiers?,jorah mormont
"Is it 'we' already, Ser Barristan? If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it. That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done.",jorah mormont
"The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents.",daenerys targaryen
"How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan?",jorah mormont
Have you ever seen a war where innocents didn't die by the thousands?,jorah mormont
"I was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi. You know what I saw? Butchery. Babies, children, old men. More women raped than you can count. There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand. But the Unsullied are not men. They do not rape. They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so. If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead.",jorah mormont
"Do you disagree, Ser Barristan?",daenerys targaryen
"Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, and Rhaegar died.",jorah mormont
"Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?",daenerys targaryen
I wish I had known him. But he was not the last dragon.,daenerys targaryen
They did not. I want to buy them all.,daenerys targaryen
Yes. eight thousand. And the ones still in training as well.,daenerys targaryen
I will have them all or take none. Many will fall in battle. I'll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop.,daenerys targaryen
I have dragons. I'll give you one.,daenerys targaryen
"Khaleesi, please.",jorah mormont
One.,daenerys targaryen
Done.,daenerys targaryen

Do you have a name?,daenerys targaryen
Do you have a family? A mother and a father you'd return to if you had the choice?,daenerys targaryen
You belong to me now. It is your duty to tell me the truth.,daenerys targaryen
I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment. Do you know what he said to me? 'Let me die.',daenerys targaryen
Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience?,daenerys targaryen
And what about you? You know that I'm taking you to war. You may go hungry. You may fall sick. You may be killed.,daenerys targaryen
"Yes, all men must die. But we are not men.",daenerys targaryen
A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers.,tyrion lannister
I'm surprised you're surprised. This is the safest place in the city.,petyr baelish
Not for bastards.,tyrion lannister
"Thank you, my dear.",petyr baelish
Pod. Pod. Take them outside. I'll be there in a moment.,tyrion lannister
I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.,petyr baelish
"Only my life. Not all that significant, I'm afraid.",tyrion lannister
You should have him knighted.,petyr baelish
If only the Master of Coin had such power.,tyrion lannister
If only. I owe you a significant debt. Our redheaded friend. You secured her release when the queen detained her.,petyr baelish
"Oh, that. Of course. A simple misunderstanding.",tyrion lannister
"Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship.",petyr baelish
We don't. I did fuck her once.,tyrion lannister
I know.,petyr baelish
But we don't.,tyrion lannister
I know. But how would the queen get that idea?,petyr baelish
Why don't you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position?,tyrion lannister
Keep a low profile.,petyr baelish
"If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are.",tyrion lannister
"Well, you are richer than I am.",petyr baelish
Good point.,tyrion lannister
"They're only numbers. Numbers on paper. Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave. Trivial even. You want a real challenge? Try whores.",petyr baelish

"Come on, I'm here later. Come on.",bronn

You think all reading is dull reading.,tyrion lannister
It's an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know.,bronn
The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages.,tyrion lannister
Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he's really up to.,bronn

Podrick.,tyrion lannister
"After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable. Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?",tyrion lannister
Wonderful. Genna specializes in first-timers.,tyrion lannister

"For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician. Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold.",tyrion lannister
Let me guess. He's not a magician.,bronn
No.,tyrion lannister
He's stealing it?,bronn
"Worse, he's borrowing it.",tyrion lannister
What's wrong with that?,bronn
"We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it. The crown owes millions to my father.",tyrion lannister
"Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne, I imagine he'll forgive that debt.",bronn
"Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, you're strangely naive.",tyrion lannister
I've never borrowed money before. I'm not clear on the rules.,bronn
"Well, ahem, the basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest.",tyrion lannister
And what if I don't?,bronn
"Well, you have to.",tyrion lannister
But what if I don't?,bronn
"This is why I don't lend you money. Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about. It's the Iron Bank of Braavos. We owe them tens of millions. If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies. One way or another, they always get their gold back.",tyrion lannister
"Ah, the return of the conquering hero. Does he have a little jaunt in his step?",tyrion lannister
The lado s practically skipping.,bronn
You were gone a long time. I trust you got your money's worth. Or should I say my money's worth?,tyrion lannister
"Oh, it was a gift, Podrick. This is more than I give you in a year.",tyrion lannister
He's a squire. You don't pay him.,bronn
"Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year.",tyrion lannister
Maybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin.,bronn
Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.,tyrion lannister
What did you tell them?,bronn
What did you do to them?,tyrion lannister
And they seemed to like these things?,tyrion lannister
Of course they seemed to like it. They're paid to seem to like it.,bronn
Only they weren't paid.,tyrion lannister
"What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free?",bronn
Is that what you're telling us?,tyrion lannister

She's Brienne of Tarth. Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth. Heard of Tarth?,jaime lannister
They call it the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why? Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth. Sapphires are gemstones. The blue ones.,jaime lannister
"Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight in sapphires if she's returned to him. But only if she's alive, her honor unbesmirched.",jaime lannister
Not defiled.,jaime lannister

Fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable. Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding.,jaime lannister

End your life?,varys
"I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid. Which is why I'm coming to you. I need proof.",tyrion lannister
Proof? Will there be a trial?,varys
I need to know.,tyrion lannister
"I have no proof, only whispers. Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still?",varys
I don't know. Do I?,tyrion lannister
"As a boy, I traveled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts.",varys
"Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which-",tyrion lannister
You do not possess at the moment.,varys
"But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special.",varys
The sorcerer.,tyrion lannister
"Hello, my old friend. It's been a long time. I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it.",varys
I'm sorry. He's beautiful.,sam

Is he very large?,varys
Extraordinary.,varys
We're talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple?,varys
What did he do to them?,varys
So what did they say?,varys
Huh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?,varys
"Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her. Sad, really. Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?",varys
What makes you say so?,varys
Ah. You can read. Rare for a woman in your profession.,varys
Of course. I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?,varys
Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls?,varys
How do you know?,varys
Prodigies in odd places indeed.,varys
You murdered Mycah. The butchers boy. My friend. He was twelve years old. He was unarmed. And you rode him down. You slung him over your horse like he was some deer.,arya stark

My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts.,cersei lannister
"Myself, I often find them a hindrance.",petyr baelish

I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?,olenna tyrell
It's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it.,tyrion lannister
Naturally.,olenna tyrell
It's shaping up to be a very involved affair. The word extravagant has been used.,tyrion lannister
What good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?,olenna tyrell
I understand that.,tyrion lannister
Good.,olenna tyrell
"But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown. As of now, it's a huge expense.",tyrion lannister
And?,olenna tyrell
"And we're at war, Lady Olenna.",tyrion lannister
"Oh, I'd nearly forgotten.",olenna tyrell
"Yes, and maintaining supply lines-",tyrion lannister
"I can't think how it slipped my mind. What is it, twelve thousand infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? Two thousand in support. Provisions so this city might survive the winter. A million bushels of wheat. Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye. Twenty thousand head of cattle. Fifty thousand sheep. You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses. I'm quite familiar with them.",olenna tyrell
And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.,tyrion lannister
"As is a royal wedding. The people are hungry for more than just food. They crave distractions. And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own. And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces. A royal wedding is much safer. Wouldn't you say?",olenna tyrell
I would.,tyrion lannister
And traditionally paid for by the royal family.,olenna tyrell
"I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched. You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper. Where did you go for them, Volantis?",olenna tyrell

Why should I care how you die?,brienne
"You swore a solemn vow, remember? You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him.",jaime lannister
That was unworthy. Forgive me. You protected me better than most-,jaime lannister
Don't you mock me.,brienne
I'm apologizing. I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce.,jaime lannister
You need trust to have a truce.,brienne
I trust you.,jaime lannister
There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for seventeen years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire?,jaime lannister
Of course.,brienne
"The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?",jaime lannister
"First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. 'Burn them all,' he kept saying. 'Burn them all.' I don't think he expected to die. He- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me.",jaime lannister
If this is true why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?,brienne
Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?,jaime lannister
Help! Help! The Kingslayer!,brienne

The Karstarks are gone. Almost half our forces. Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel. Nothing. Only wait.,robb stark

"Winter could last five years. Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again. When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission. Now we're like a band of bickering children.",robb stark

I have good news. I'll be leaving the city soon.,petyr baelish
You still want me to come with you?,sansa stark
"It's not a question of what I want. It's what you want. You want to go home, don't you?",petyr baelish
"Of course. More than anything. But maybe it would be better to wait. I've been thinking how dangerous it would be. Not just for me, but for you. You've been so kind. I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you. I can't tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare.",sansa stark
"I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa. Your true friend.",petyr baelish
"I do, Lord Baelish.",sansa stark
Petyr.,petyr baelish
Petyr.,sansa stark
"If you wish to stay, then of course you will stay.",petyr baelish
We'll speak again when I return.,petyr baelish
You're late.,tywin lannister
What's she doing here?,tyrion lannister
"Our business concerns her, too. Sit.",tywin lannister
"You'll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I've saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding.",tyrion lannister
Never mind that now. We have something important to discuss.,tywin lannister
I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important.,tyrion lannister
Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable.,tyrion lannister
Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.,tywin lannister
"Very well. She's a lovely girl. Missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do.",tyrion lannister
Your jokes are not appreciated.,tywin lannister
"It wasn't my best, but-",tyrion lannister
"I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me.",tywin lannister
Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother.,tyrion lannister
The Karstarks have marched home. The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered. Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers. That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell. And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.,tywin lannister
The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?,tyrion lannister
There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot. Plots are not public knowledge. And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.,tywin lannister
And how do we do that?,tyrion lannister
We find Sansa Stark a different husband.,tywin lannister
Wonderful.,tyrion lannister
"Yes, it is.",cersei lannister
You can't mean it.,tyrion lannister
I can and I do.,tywin lannister
Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head. Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me? That's cruel even for you.,tyrion lannister
"Do you intend on mistreating her? The girl's happiness is not my concern, nor should it be yours.",tywin lannister
She's a child!,tyrion lannister
"She's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length.",cersei lannister
"There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her. Surely you're capable of that.",tywin lannister
And if I refuse?,tyrion lannister
You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle. Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for. And it is past time you were wed.,tywin lannister
I was wed. Or don't you remember?,tyrion lannister
Only too well.,tywin lannister
You should be thanking the gods for this. This is more than you deserve.,cersei lannister
Tyrion will do as he's bid. As will you.,tywin lannister
What do you mean?,cersei lannister
You'll marry Ser Loras.,tywin lannister
I will not.,cersei lannister
"The boy is heir to Highgarden. Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach.",tywin lannister
"No, I won't do it.",cersei lannister
"Yes, you will. You're still fertile. You need to marry again and breed.",tywin lannister
"I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare.",cersei lannister
You're my daughter! You will do as I command and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumors about you once and for all.,tywin lannister
"Father, don't make me do it again, please.",cersei lannister
Not another word. My children. You've disgraced the Lannister name for far too long.,tywin lannister
"But the more wood, the bigger the fire.",sam
Huh. You know your fires.,sam
"It doesn't get so cold down in the Reach. And there were servants, of course.",sam
"Oh, I found something at the Fist of the First Men. Buried treasure. Thousands of years old. I think.",sam
"I'm not sure that it does anything. It's beautiful, though, isn't it?",sam
Not so far. A few more days.,sam
Bigger. So big you can't even see the top sometimes. It's hidden in clouds.,sam
"I'm not. It's seven hundred feet high, all made of ice. On a warm day you can see it weeping. Castle Black is nice enough. They keep a fire burning in the long hall day and night. And Hobb makes venison stew with onions. Very tasty. Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing. Dareon sings best.",sam
"No. No, no, no. Not very well.",sam
"Oh, all right. Let's see.",sam
"Oh ahem. The father's face is stern and strong / He sits and judges right from wrong / He weighs our lives, the short and long / And loves the little children / The mother gives the gift of life / And watches over every wife / Her gentle smile ends all strife /And she loves her little children.",sam
You ever climbed it before?,jon snow
Aren't you?,jon snow
You kill someone for them?,jon snow
Can we not talk about that here?,jon snow
Did I seem scared the other day?,jon snow
Only in the beginning.,jon snow
What secret?,jon snow
I won't.,jon snow
Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne.,arya stark
"Face, tits, balls- I hit 'em right where I wanted to.",arya stark
What?,arya stark
But I have to aim.,arya stark
Never aim?,arya stark
There's someone out there.,arya stark
I don't like that woman.,arya stark
What does that have to do with anything?,arya stark
What are you doing? Let go of him.,arya stark
Tell them to stop. Come on. He wants to be one of you. He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them!,arya stark
Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she?,arya stark
You're not doing this for your god. You're doing it for gold.,arya stark
You're a witch. You're going to hurt him.,arya stark
Wa-,theon greyjoy
Please.,theon greyjoy
"I'll tell you everything, please.",theon greyjoy
"If I win, you'll let me go?",theon greyjoy
The North.,theon greyjoy
Deepwood Motte.,theon greyjoy
Last Hearth.,theon greyjoy
Karhold!,theon greyjoy
No. It was just a guess.,theon greyjoy
Torrhen Karstark.,theon greyjoy
He was your brother. Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.,theon greyjoy
You swore to tell me if I-,theon greyjoy
Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's bannerman. I betrayed Robb. That's why you're torturing me.,theon greyjoy
"Please, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off!",theon greyjoy
Thank you for riding here so quickly. I know travel isn't easy in these times.,robb stark
Of course. He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.,robb stark
We are fighting for the North. Harrenhal is not in the North. It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it.,robb stark
We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.,robb stark
He has every right to be. Please excuse us while we discuss it.,robb stark
He's a proud man and we've wounded him.,robb stark
"It's all right. You heard him. If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead.",robb stark
You're willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?,catelyn stark
I have a war to fight. We can't win it without them. I have no time to haggle. You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.,robb stark
"I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war. If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost.",robb stark
"You're paying for my sins, Uncle. It's not fair or right. I'll remember it.",robb stark
"Yes. Most kind of them. You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton. I am acting on Lady Stark's orders to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing.",brienne
"You should. But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner. Why might that be?",jaime lannister
We both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.,jaime lannister
"It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it.",jaime lannister
He'll make time for you.,jaime lannister
Shall we drink on it?,jaime lannister
You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?,jaime lannister
"Very well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident.",jaime lannister
I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to-,brienne
I'm afraid I must insist.,jaime lannister
Impossible.,olenna tyrell
Why?,tywin lannister
My grandson is the pride of Highgarden. The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms. Your daughter-,olenna tyrell
"Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king.",tywin lannister
Old.,olenna tyrell
Old?,tywin lannister
"Old. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely.",olenna tyrell
"The years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities. Do you deny them?",tywin lannister
"Oh, not at all. A sword swallower through and through.",olenna tyrell
And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.,tywin lannister
"Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?",olenna tyrell
Of course.,tywin lannister
And you never-,olenna tyrell
No.,tywin lannister
Not once? Not in any way?,olenna tyrell
Never.,tywin lannister
"I congratulate you upon your restraint. But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets.",olenna tyrell
Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.,tywin lannister
"I wouldn't say that. True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters- where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out.",olenna tyrell
I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.,tywin lannister
"Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation.",olenna tyrell
I don't care what people believe. And neither do you.,tywin lannister
"As an authority on myself, I must disagree.",olenna tyrell
"Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt.",tywin lannister
"And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt. It is a chance we simply cannot take.",olenna tyrell
The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. All right. I'll remove it for you.,tywin lannister
"If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard. I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows. He will never marry. He will never have children.",tywin lannister
Oh,olenna tyrell
The Tyrell name will fade. And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.,tywin lannister
You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?,olenna tyrell
"I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?",tywin lannister
It's a rare enough thing- a man who lives up to his reputation.,olenna tyrell
Take my hand!,jon snow
That's a wonderful pin.,sansa stark
I'm very happy about,sansa stark
I feel like I'm in a dream.,sansa stark
No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place.,sansa stark
I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.,tyrion lannister
We can have them both killed.,cersei lannister
It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.,tyrion lannister
Father doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together.,cersei lannister
On a boat you built.,tyrion lannister
The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family.,cersei lannister
I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.,tyrion lannister
"I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate.",cersei lannister
Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?,tyrion lannister
"The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot.",tyrion lannister
What do you want me to say?,cersei lannister
I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.,tyrion lannister
Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here.,cersei lannister
Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.,tyrion lannister
"Not the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands.",cersei lannister
"You may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels.",tyrion lannister
"When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere.",cersei lannister
"Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked.",tyrion lannister
Who's going to tell her?,cersei lannister
Do you think people will like it?,sansa stark
"You're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding. Loras likes green and gold brocade.",sansa stark
Will they let me invite my family?,sansa stark
But do you think they will?,sansa stark
"I beg your pardon, my lady.",tyrion lannister
"Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding.",sansa stark
"Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa.",tyrion lannister
Of course.,sansa stark
"Alone, if I may.",tyrion lannister
"Shae. Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to.",sansa stark
Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.,tyrion lannister
"It's all right, really.",sansa stark
How to begin? It's- this- this- this is awkward.,tyrion lannister
"A thousand blades taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread.",varys
There aren't. There aren't even two hundred. I've counted.,petyr baelish
"Ha, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing. Yet it has a certain appeal. The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice.",varys
"Early days, my friend. It is flattering, really, you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want.",petyr baelish
"Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you. Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?",varys
"You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience.",petyr baelish
I did what I did for the good of the realm.,varys
The realm? Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies. A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie.,petyr baelish
But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.,varys
Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.,petyr baelish
Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them.,petyr baelish
"And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.",petyr baelish
"About a week, I think.",jon snow
"When we went to Castle Black, we took the Kingsroad.",jon snow
"Most of the time, yes.",jon snow
"They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil.",jon snow
Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.,jon snow
They help the men march.,jon snow
"Well, it's- it's the rhythm.",jon snow
"No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming.",jon snow
I know you cut me loose on the Wall.,jon snow
And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?,jon snow
Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.,robb stark
Lord Walder is prickly by nature.,catelyn stark
"Yes, and that is why-",catelyn stark
Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.,catelyn stark
He's getting a wedding. It was a king he wanted.,catelyn stark
Edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house. We should all get some sleep.,robb stark
"If you don't put some clothes on, I can't promise I won't attack you again.",robb stark
Who are you writing?,robb stark
Is that Valyrian?,robb stark
Gaaa? Say hello for me.,robb stark
Ritsas.,robb stark
Does she know her daughter's a queen?,robb stark
"That will be a surprise, I expect.",robb stark
How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you're over there looking like that?,robb stark
I will.,robb stark
"What, now? Are you certain?",robb stark
Angry? You're my queen.,robb stark
Maybe one of each.,robb stark
I love you. Do you hear me? I love you.,robb stark
"Growing up at Winterfell, all I ever wanted was to escape, to come here to the capital. See the southern knights and their painted armor and King's Landing after dark- all the candles burning in all those windows. I'm stupid. A stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns.",sansa stark
How do I make the best of my circumstances? I have to marry him.,sansa stark
No.,sansa stark
He's tried.,sansa stark
He's a Lannister.,sansa stark
I'm sorry. Here I am complaining to you.,sansa stark
My son with him. I'll have to- we'll have to-,sansa stark
I'm not afraid of the pain. Not after what Joffrey's done to me.,sansa stark
He's a dwarf. And Loras- Loras.,sansa stark
And that's a good thing?,sansa stark
How do you know all this? Did your mother teach you?,sansa stark
She's a child.,tyrion lannister
She's a foot taller than you.,bronn
A tall child.,tyrion lannister
What's the youngest you've ever had?,bronn
Not that young.,tyrion lannister
How much older?,bronn
Older.,tyrion lannister
"You're a lord, she's a lady. And a beauty at that. I don't see the problem.",bronn
Shae isn't going to like it.,tyrion lannister
Shae is a whore. Are you gonna marry her? Eh? How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?,bronn
I should never have told you about that.,tyrion lannister
"You want Shae, keep her. Wed one and bed the other. All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl. He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day. You can rule the North in his name. You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own.",bronn
Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them.,tyrion lannister
"You waste time trying to get people to love you, you'll end up the most popular dead man in town. You want to fuck that Stark girl. You just don't want to admit it.",bronn
I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head. The ones already there don't need company.,tyrion lannister
You pay me to kill people who bother you. Evil notions come free.,bronn
Your Grace.,tywin lannister
You wanted to speak to me?,tywin lannister
"You're welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace. Any or all of them.",tywin lannister
Of course.,tywin lannister
"I have, yes.",tywin lannister
"The Tower of the Hand is where I work. To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively.",tywin lannister
We could arrange to have you carried.,tywin lannister
Where did you hear about this?,tywin lannister
Apparently so.,tywin lannister
"When I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room. The skull of the last of them was right here. It was the size of an apple.",tywin lannister
"Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago. Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us.",tywin lannister
Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing.,tywin lannister
You are being counseled at this very moment.,tywin lannister
"From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary. Your Grace.",tywin lannister
Yunkai. The Yellow City.,jorah mormont
"On the field, with ease. But they won't meet us on the field. They have provisions, patience, and strong walls. If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man.",jorah mormont
I don't want half my army killed before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.,daenerys targaryen
"We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi. Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne.",jorah mormont
How many slaves are there in Yunkai?,daenerys targaryen
Two hundred thousand if not more.,jorah mormont
Then we have Two hundred thousand reasons to take the city.,daenerys targaryen
"Send a man to the city gates. Tell the slavers I will receive them here, and accept their surrender. Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor.",daenerys targaryen
You may approach. Sit.,daenerys targaryen
Good. My Unsullied need practice. I was told to blood them early.,daenerys targaryen
My ship?,daenerys targaryen
And what do you ask in return?,daenerys targaryen
I have a gift for you as well. Your life.,daenerys targaryen
"And the lives of your wise masters. But I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai. Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude. Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy.",daenerys targaryen
"I did, but my dragons made no promises. And you threatened their mother.",daenerys targaryen
"My gold. You gave it to me, remember? And I shall put it to good use. You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you. Now get out.",daenerys targaryen
And what happens to things that don't bend? He said he had powerful friends. Who was he talking about?,daenerys targaryen
I don't know.,jorah mormont
Find out.,daenerys targaryen
Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport. Smithed in Casterly Rock.,tyrion lannister
You could buy a ship with these.,tyrion lannister
What?,tyrion lannister
Of course you're not going anywhere.,tyrion lannister
I didn't ask for this marriage. I didn't want it.,tyrion lannister
"That doesn't mean that- this is duty, not desire.",tyrion lannister
I don't have a choice. My father-,tyrion lannister
What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.,tyrion lannister
My feelings for you have not changed. I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.,tyrion lannister
I swear to you it will not be like that.,tyrion lannister
"I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city. You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants. Any children we might have will be well provided for.",tyrion lannister
"Listen. Listen to me, my lady.",tyrion lannister
You are. You'll always be my lady.,tyrion lannister
I don't talk to traitors.,arya stark
But you did. You took the gold and you gave him up.,arya stark
He's not my one true god.,arya stark
Death.,arya stark
But what about Riverrun? It's not south. It's west of here.,arya stark
You swore.,arya stark
Why? So you can steal their gold?,arya stark
"I don't care what you swear because you're a liar. You lied to Gendry, you lied to me. You'll lie to anyone. I hope the Lannisters kill you all.",arya stark
I thought you were gone.,brienne
Tomorrow.,jaime lannister
Have they told you what they plan to do with me?,brienne
Lord Bolton's traveling tomorrow as well. He's going to the Twins for Edmure Tully's wedding. You're to remain here.,jaime lannister
With Locke?,brienne
I owe you a debt.,jaime lannister
"When Catelyn Stark released you, we both made a promise to her. Now it's your promise. You gave your word. Keep it and consider the debt paid.",brienne
I will return the Stark girls to their mother. I swear it.,jaime lannister
"Good-bye, Ser Jaime.",brienne
My father will make him Grand Maester if he grows me a new hand.,jaime lannister
Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I couldn't make his uncle's wedding. The Lannisters send their regards.,jaime lannister
Where is he?,theon greyjoy
Please.,theon greyjoy
He sent you.,theon greyjoy
Help me. If he comes back-,theon greyjoy

You're gonna scare it off.,jon snow
It's too far away.,jon snow
It's a windmill.,jon snow

"Six times in the last thousand years, a King has attacked the kingdoms. Six times they failed.",jon snow

You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together.,jon snow
"I do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you.",jon snow
"Yes, first we'll live.",jon snow
What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?,jaime lannister
"Yes, we've stymied the corruption. You're a learned man.",jaime lannister
You did well sewing up this mess. You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle.,jaime lannister
So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many?,jaime lannister
What is?,jaime lannister
You performed experiments on living men.,jaime lannister
With their permission?,jaime lannister
"Dying paupers, I assume. Men with no families to complain. You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside.",jaime lannister
I don't know.,jaime lannister
Countless has a nice ring to it.,jaime lannister
Half a million. The population of King's Landing. You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal. Did you- did you get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth?,jaime lannister
A fair offer.,jaime lannister
Why not?,jaime lannister
They'd be fools to kill her.,jaime lannister
We have to return to Harrenhal.,jaime lannister
I've left something behind.,jaime lannister
And what are those orders?,jaime lannister
You think you'll get a reward.,jaime lannister
"You think you're getting a reward. Let me explain something to you. When my father sees me, the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand. And I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off.",jaime lannister
Or I could tell him this man saved my life. We return to Harrenhal now.,jaime lannister
Whoa.,jaime lannister
Be quiet.,jaime lannister
A wooden sword?,jaime lannister
You gave her a wooden sword.,jaime lannister
"I'll pay her bloody ransom. Gold, sapphires, whatever you want. Just get her out of there.",jaime lannister
Ah!,brienne
Get behind me.,jaime lannister
I will not.,brienne
Pull her up.,jaime lannister
Hold my legs.,brienne
Pull him up!,brienne
We're taking her to King's Landing. Unless you kill me.,jaime lannister
What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton? Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive?,jaime lannister
"Well, we must be on our way. Sorry about the sapphires.",jaime lannister
There's no one worse than you.,arya stark
You're lying.,arya stark
Is that the Blackwater?,arya stark
Back to King's Landing to Joffrey and the queen.,arya stark
But why?,arya stark
Why would they be at the Twins?,arya stark
They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid. The Yunkish are paying them well.,jorah mormont
You know these men?,daenerys targaryen
"Only by the broken swords on their banners. They're called the Second Sons. A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, ""The Titan's Bastard.""",jorah mormont
Is he more titan or bastard?,daenerys targaryen
"He's a dangerous man, khaleesi. They all are.",jorah mormont
How many?,daenerys targaryen
Enough to make a difference?,daenerys targaryen
It's hard to collect wages from a corpse. I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.,daenerys targaryen
I imagine you're right.,jorah mormont
I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.,daenerys targaryen
He may not agree to meet.,jorah mormont
He will. A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.,daenerys targaryen
Mind your tongue.,jorah mormont
We have no slaves here.,daenerys targaryen
"Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded. Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?",daenerys targaryen
"We have more, don't we?",daenerys targaryen
"I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us.",daenerys targaryen
You're very young to be a captain.,daenerys targaryen
"Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds don't favor your side.",daenerys targaryen
The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.,jorah mormont
Or you could fight for me.,daenerys targaryen
I would pay you as much and more.,daenerys targaryen
Ride with me and you'll never need another contract. You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.,daenerys targaryen
"A fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons. You have two days to decide.",daenerys targaryen
These men are our guests. You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder.,daenerys targaryen
"A barrel, then.",daenerys targaryen
"Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first.",daenerys targaryen
"Half Robert, half lowborn.",stannis baratheon
What do you mean to do with him?,stannis baratheon
"Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes? If it needs to be done, do it. Don't torture the boy.",stannis baratheon
No.,stannis baratheon
You've slaughtered many lambs?,stannis baratheon
"And tho- and thowg V-v-visenya Targaryen rod- rode Vhagar- Vhag-' Fuck me. 'Visenya Targaryen rode Vhagar, the smallest of the dragons, though still large enog- enough- enough to swallow a horse whole.",davos
Your Grace.,davos
They feeding you enough?,stannis baratheon
"Two meals a day. Cold for breakfast, hot for supper. I cannot complain.",davos
You don't belong in a place like this.,stannis baratheon
"Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse.",davos
Yeah.,stannis baratheon
I'm sorry about your son. Didn't get the chance to tell you before. Good lad. Loyal lad.,davos
Melisandre's returned.,stannis baratheon
I didn't know she'd been gone.,davos
Came back with a bastard boy. Robert's bastard boy.,stannis baratheon
Why?,davos
She says there's power in king's blood.,stannis baratheon
She's going to kill him.,davos
Sacrifice him.,stannis baratheon
"Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice? The boy is your nephew.",davos
What of it? We're at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?,stannis baratheon
Because he has your blood in his veins.,davos
So did Renly.,stannis baratheon
"Renly wronged you. Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you. He raised an army, stole your bannermen. This boy has done you no harm. He's an innocent.",davos
"How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women?The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. Unless I triumph. I never asked for this. No more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty. What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?",stannis baratheon
"Your Grace, why did you come to see me today?",davos
I came to free you. If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.,stannis baratheon
I swear it. I can't swear never to speak against her.,davos
You have little regard for your own life.,stannis baratheon
"Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I'd counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself. You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory. When my son was five he said to me, 'I don't ever want to die. ' I wanted to say to him, 'You won't, child. You won't ever.' I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid. I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night.",davos
"I saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?",stannis baratheon
Lady Sansa.,tyrion lannister
"You look very handsome, my lord.",sansa stark
"Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden?",tyrion lannister
"My lady, I want you to know I didn't ask for this.",tyrion lannister
"I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord.",sansa stark
"No, don't. You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore. You won't be a prisoner after today. You'll be my wife. I suppose that's a different kind of prison. I just wanted to say- I'm just trying to say, very badly- I just- just want to say I know how you feel.",tyrion lannister
"I doubt that very much, my lord.",sansa stark
You're right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel.,tyrion lannister
"But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you. Do you drink wine?",tyrion lannister
When I have to.,sansa stark
"Well, today you have to.",tyrion lannister
Radiant? Why radiant?,cersei lannister
"You're a musical girl, aren't you? I imagine you have a lovely voice.",cersei lannister
"Ah, but you know the song 'The Rains of Castamere'?",cersei lannister
So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?,cersei lannister
House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?,cersei lannister
"Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now?",cersei lannister
"Gone. A gentle word. Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword.",cersei lannister
"I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. 'And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear.'",cersei lannister
"If you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep.",cersei lannister
What are you doing?,sansa stark
Could you-,tyrion lannister
Thank you.,tyrion lannister
The usurper Robb Stark. The usurper Balon Greyjoy. The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.,stannis baratheon
"So their son will be your nephew. After you're wed to Cersei, of course. And you will be the king's stepfather and brother-in-law. When you marry the king, Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law and your son will be Loras' nephew? Grandson? I'm not sure. But your brother will become your father-in-law. That much is beyond dispute.",olenna tyrell
"Will you pardon me, my lord?",sansa stark
Of course. Of course. En-enjoy.,tyrion lannister
Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead.,cersei lannister
Stay.,cersei lannister
You seem rather drunk.,tywin lannister
Rather less than I plan to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?,tyrion lannister
"This isn't about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible.",tywin lannister
And?,tyrion lannister
"If you're going to give her one, you need to perform.",tywin lannister
What did you once call me? A drunken little lust-filled beast.,tyrion lannister
More than once.,tywin lannister
"There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit.",tyrion lannister
"You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty.",tywin lannister
Nobody cares what your father once told you.,cersei lannister
"Thank you, Your Grace.",sansa stark
"Yes, Your Grace.",sansa stark
There will be no bedding ceremony.,tyrion lannister
Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.,tyrion lannister
"I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace. I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king.",tywin lannister
"A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won't even know I'm there.",tyrion lannister
"Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace.",tywin lannister
I am. Guilty. But- but it is my wedding night.,tyrion lannister
"My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife.",tyrion lannister
"I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree? Come, I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood.",tyrion lannister
"Is that wise, my lord?",sansa stark
"Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion.",tyrion lannister
"Is that wise, Tyrion?",sansa stark
Nothing was ever wiser.,tyrion lannister
Astoundingly long.,tyrion lannister
What?,sansa stark
Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly?,tyrion lannister
Fourteen.,sansa stark
"Well, talk won't make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage.",tyrion lannister
"Stop. I can't. I could, I won't.",tyrion lannister
But your father-,sansa stark
"If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to.",tyrion lannister
What if I never want you to?,sansa stark
And so my watch begins.,tyrion lannister
Ninteen,daenerys targaryen
How can anyone speak nineteen languages?,daenerys targaryen
"Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope- what do you mean reasonably well?",daenerys targaryen
Drogo said I spoke Dothroaki like one born to it. It gave him great pride.,daenerys targaryen
Athjahaka.,daenerys targaryen
Athjahakar.,daenerys targaryen
"Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice.",daenerys targaryen
What do you want?,daenerys targaryen
Let her go.,daenerys targaryen
You were sent here to kill me?,daenerys targaryen
So why haven't you?,daenerys targaryen
What do your captains have to say about that?,daenerys targaryen
Why?,daenerys targaryen
Over what?,daenerys targaryen
You're a strange man.,daenerys targaryen
And this is supposed to impress me?,daenerys targaryen
Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?,daenerys targaryen
Will you fight for me?,daenerys targaryen
Swear to me.,daenerys targaryen
You really ought to knock.,tyrion lannister
It's getting dark. We could stay here for the night.,sam
How hard can it be to build a fire?,sam
He winked at me before.,sam
I saw him wink at me.,sam
I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink.,sam
"Well, I mean, there's no real difference.",sam
You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.,sam
What? No. This is just the way I talk.,sam
Don't you think he should have a name?,sam
"Let's see, there's Duncan, Kevan, Jo,n Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer.",sam
"Uh, yes. Maybe that's not-",sam
"That's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name.",sam
"Well, it's a family name. For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly. Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name. You see? So my father is also a Tarly.",sam
"No, Randyll Tarly.",sam
Please don't name him Randyll.,sam
Different manner of cruel.,sam
I'll be back. I just want to look.,sam
Go inside. Go back inside. I'll-,sam
Stay back!,sam
You stay back!,sam
Are you sure about this?,catelyn stark
No.,robb stark
It's dangerous.,catelyn stark
"If we take Tywin's castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize he's not invincible. Take his home, take his gold, take his power.",robb stark
Why are you telling me?,catelyn stark
You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice.,robb stark
Now Winterfell is burned to the ground. The North is overrun with Ironborn and Bran and Rickon are gone.,robb stark
"So, Casterly Rock? I'm asking your advice.",robb stark
We have enough men?,catelyn stark
If Walder Frey cooperates.,robb stark
"If reinforcements arrive from King's Landing, before we take the castle, we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea.",catelyn stark
We'll lose the war and die the way father died. Or worse.,robb stark
Show them how it feels to lose what they love.,catelyn stark
"We thank you for your hospitality, my lord.",robb stark
"I have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness.",robb stark
"My ladies. All men should keep their word, kings most of all. I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow. The fault is not with you. Any man would be lucky to have any one of you. I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another. I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house. I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends.",robb stark
"Thank you, my lord.",robb stark
Where?,daenerys targaryen
Your men but not you?,jorah mormont
"Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army. The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won't have to split it three ways cause you've already slaughtered your partners.",jorah mormont
You command the Unsullied. What do you think?,jorah mormont
"Lo jention mirre nūmāzme ēza, iderenna qopsa verdagon issa.",daenerys targaryen
You leave tonight.,daenerys targaryen
Very good. We'll prepare.,jorah mormont
"You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan. Your place is by the Queen. If we are truly her loyal servants, we'll do whatever needs to be done. No matter the cost, no matter our pride.",jorah mormont
Don't! Don't kill him.,arya stark
"You're so dangerous, aren't you? Saying scary things to little girls. Killing little boys and old people. A real hard man you are.",arya stark
You're wrong. I know a killer. A real killer.,arya stark
You'd be like a kitten to him. He'd kill you with his little finger.,arya stark
No.,arya stark
Don't kill him! Please. Please don't.,arya stark
He breeds them for the Watch.,jon snow
The Watch protects him.,jon snow
We just take the horses and go. The old man's no threat.,jon snow
The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief. They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.,jon snow
Ygritte!,jon snow
No one's going to believe you're a hog farmer if you eat them all.,arya stark
I know they're still there.,arya stark
I'm not afraid.,arya stark
I knew fear when I saw it in you. You're afraid of fire.,arya stark
"When Beric's sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl.",arya stark
"And I know why, too. I heard what your brother did to you. Pressed your face to the fire like you're a nice juicy mutton chop.",arya stark
Might do.,arya stark
Someday I'm gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull.,arya stark
You were right the whole time.,jon snow
There may be others.,jorah mormont
That's what you call a few guards?,jorah mormont
"We've been waiting a long time. Haven't we? Well I don't know, you tell me. How long does it take to sack a city?",daenerys targaryen
It was just as you said. They did not believe until it was too late. Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered.,jorah mormont
And Daario Naharis?,daenerys targaryen
He complained about this marriage the entire ride from Riverrun and now look at him.,catelyn stark
Uncle.,catelyn stark
"Don't you drink, Lord Bolton?",catelyn stark
I hope she makes you very happy.,catelyn stark
My mother's alone with Roose Bolton. I should rescue her.,robb stark
Be kind. She's finally starting to like you.,robb stark
Perhaps I've made a terrible mistake.,robb stark
Striking your king is an act of treason.,robb stark
"If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them.",robb stark
Poor girl.,catelyn stark
"Oh, Ned forbade it. He said it wouldn't be right if he broke a man's jaw on our wedding night.",catelyn stark
I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner's perspective.,robb stark
"It's tradition. Without the bedding ceremony, there's no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage.",robb stark
Boy or girl?,robb stark
"Oh, do you? It seems to me the father should have some say in his son's naming.",robb stark
I do.,robb stark
Robb!,catelyn stark
"Lord Walder! Lord Walder, enough! Let it end! Please! He is my son! My first son! Let him go and I swear that we will forget this! I swear it by the Old Gods and New! We will take no vengeance.",catelyn stark
"Take me for a hostage but let Robb go! Robb, get up! Get up and walk out! Please! Please!",catelyn stark
"On my honor as a Tully, on my honor as a Stark, let him go or I will cut your wife's throat!",catelyn stark
Mother.,robb stark
Hmm. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.,tyrion lannister
What are you doing?,sansa stark
I have a list.,tyrion lannister
A list of people you mean to kill?,sansa stark
"For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme. Fear of death, on the other hand-",tyrion lannister
You should learn to ignore them.,sansa stark
"My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you. I'm the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp.",tyrion lannister
You're a Lannister. I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark.,sansa stark
The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey. We're perfect for each other.,tyrion lannister
So how should we punish them?,sansa stark
Who? Whom?,tyrion lannister
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.,sansa stark
Ah. I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions. Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.,tyrion lannister
I hear that you're a pervert.,sansa stark
I am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain.,tyrion lannister
"We could sheep shift Lord Desmondo s bed. You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside. Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again. His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from.",sansa stark
Lady Sansa!,tyrion lannister
My sister used to do that when she was angry with me. And she was always angry with me.,sansa stark
Why sheep shift?,tyrion lannister
That's the vulgar word for dung.,sansa stark
My lady-,tyrion lannister
"Well, you asked me.",sansa stark
Killed a few puppies today?,tyrion lannister
Roslin caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding. Signed Walder Frey.' Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something?,tyrion lannister
"Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage.",varys
A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.,cersei lannister
No. She is no longer yours to torment.,tyrion lannister
"Oh, I'm a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies.",tyrion lannister
Let him make his threats. Hmm? He's a bitter little man.,cersei lannister
"Any man who must say, 'I am the king' is no true king. I'll make sure you understand that when I've won your war for you.",tywin lannister
The king is tired. See him to his chambers.,tywin lannister
Come along.,cersei lannister
We have so much to celebrate. A wedding to plan. You must rest.,cersei lannister
"Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep.",tywin lannister
Come.,cersei lannister
Not you.,tywin lannister
You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.,tyrion lannister
You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.,tywin lannister
A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.,tyrion lannister
You really think a crown gives you power?,tywin lannister
No. I think armies give you power.,tyrion lannister
Mm-hmm.,tywin lannister
"Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same.",tyrion lannister
"Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances.",tyrion lannister
Which he got from me. Do you disapprove?,tywin lannister
I'm all for cheating. This is war.,tyrion lannister
But to slaughter them at a wedding. Explain to me why it is more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner.,tywin lannister
So that's why you did it? To save lives?,tyrion lannister
"To end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one. I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood.",tywin lannister
The Northerners will never forget.,tyrion lannister
Good. Let them remember what happens when they march on the south. All the Stark men are dead. Winterfell is a ruin. Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age.,tywin lannister
I believe you still have some work to do on that score.,tywin lannister
Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?,tyrion lannister
"One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant.",tywin lannister
I will not rape her.,tyrion lannister
Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?,tywin lannister
Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.,tyrion lannister
The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires.,tywin lannister
Does that amuse you?,tywin lannister
"No, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions.",tyrion lannister
"Easy for me, is it?",tywin lannister
When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?,tyrion lannister
"The day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I brought you as my son. Because you're a Lannister.",tywin lannister
Sansa.,tyrion lannister
Kill me.,theon greyjoy
Kill me!,theon greyjoy
Theon Greyjoy.,theon greyjoy
Th- Theon Greyjoy.,theon greyjoy
Please.,theon greyjoy
Reek. My name is Reek.,theon greyjoy
Don't kill me!,sam
To Castle Black. I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.,sam
Who's your brother?,sam
You're Jon's brother. The one who fell from the window.,sam
I've been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one. And I've heard all about Hodor.,sam
"I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon. If you're his brother, you're my brother, too. And anything I can do to help you, I will.",sam
What? Why in the world would you want to go-,sam
Come with us. There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall. Hodor can carry you to the top. We'll walk straight to Castle Black.,sam
"If Jon is alive, then Castle Black's where he'll be. It's the safest place for you.",sam
"What I know is what I saw. And if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way.",sam
How do you know all that?,sam
But you're going to stop them?,sam
We found them at the Fist. Someone buried them a long time ago. Someone wanted us to find them.,sam
Killing White Walkers.,sam
"Well, I suppose someone had to be the first.",sam
"And the archer. I got lucky with one of them. There are more. Many more. And for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count. I wish you'd come with us.",sam
How are you keeping?,davos
It was just a bit of blood.,davos
I'm not a highborn.,davos
A recent state of affairs. I was born in Flea Bottom just like you.,davos
I lived below the Street of Flour.,davos
The shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door on Gin Alley.,davos
"The Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights? Pfft. You lived in the fancy part of town. And here we are now. Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king.",davos
"If you mistrust fancy people so much, why were you in such a hurry to trust her?",davos
"She does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that.",davos
"Oh, that's a long story.",davos
Many years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation. He rewarded me with a lordship. And this.,davos
I didn't want to be a lord. I nearly didn't accept.,davos
I did it for my son. I didn't want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door. I wanted him to have a better life.,davos
He's dead.,davos
Following me.,davos
When did you come to this strange country?,varys
You were only a child.,varys
"You've been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know. He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father's money. Now it's just the drinking.",varys
She is a sweet young thing. None of this is her fault.,varys
"No, I expect not.",varys
"We break bread with them, but that doesn't make us family. We've learned their language, but we'll never be their countrymen. If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister-",varys
You have one name. As do I. Here only the family name matters.,varys
"Diamonds. I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself. Get on one of those ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr. You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house. Hire servants. Start a new life, a good life, far from here. The mysterious foreign beauty. You'll have suitors lining up.",varys
"Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place. He has the mind for it, he has the will, he has the right last name. And you- you are a complication. I know you love him. And I know it's true love not bought by gold and silver. I'm not asking you to leave him for money. I'm asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him. This will never be your home, my lady. Find a true home somewhere far from here while there's still time.",varys
Keep up.,tyrion lannister
It's not easy being drunk all the time. Everyone would do it if it were easy.,tyrion lannister
Leave.,cersei lannister
"So, enjoying married life? An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend.",cersei lannister
She doesn't deserve this.,tyrion lannister
Deserve? Be careful with that. Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world.,cersei lannister
There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher.,tyrion lannister
Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?,tyrion lannister
I won't be marrying Ser Loras.,cersei lannister
I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.,tyrion lannister
You're not me. You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child.,cersei lannister
So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?,tyrion lannister
So she can have some happiness in her life.,cersei lannister
You have children. How happy would you say you are?,tyrion lannister
"Not very. But if it weren't for my children, I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep. They're the reason I'm alive.",cersei lannister
Even Joffrey?,tyrion lannister
"Even Joffrey. He was all I had once. Before Myrcella was born. I used to spend hours looking at him. His wisps of hair. His tiny little hands and feet. He was such a jolly little fellow. You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies. 'We should have known. Even then we should have known.' It's nonsense. Whenever he was with me, he was happy. And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey- how it feels to have someone. Someone of your own.",cersei lannister
How long does it go on?,tyrion lannister
Until we've dealt with all our enemies.,cersei lannister
"Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more.",tyrion lannister
Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time.,cersei lannister

She hasn't chosen a name yet.,sam
"He's not my child, Maester Aemon. She's one of Craster's wives. I remember every word of the oath. Night gathers and my watch begins. I am the shield that guards the realms of men.

"Well, your father's not going to go to that.",davos
I've been trying to stay out of those dungeons my whole life.,davos
"Aye, old Balerion's definitely better than anything your cousin Rylene's got on offer. But now that I'm your father's Hand again, I have to keep him informed. The king does not have time for this drudgery. 'To all the lords and knobble men of Westeros.'",davos

And you take credit because you dropped a leech into the fire?,davos
"Your Grace, the world has got so far bent. I've seen things crawl out of nightmares, but my eyes were open. I don't know if Robb Stark died because of the Red Woman's sorcery or because at war men die all the time, but I do know that uniting the Seven Kingdoms with blood magic is wrong. It is evil. And you are not an evil man.",davos
"Do you know who had this table carved and painted, Ser Davos?",stannis baratheon
Aegon Targaryen.,davos
And do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?,stannis baratheon
"On the back of his dragon, Balerion the Dread.",davos
"He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced and a smaller army, but he had three dragons. Dragons are magic, Ser Davos. My enemies have made my kingdom bleed. I will not forget that. I will not forgive that. I will punish them with any arms at my disposal.",stannis baratheon
"You do not need to burn the boy. If what you say is true, a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark-",davos
His name is Gendry. He's a good lad. A poor lad from Flea Bottom who happens to be your nephew.,davos
What is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom?,stannis baratheon
Everything.,davos
The boy must die.,stannis baratheon
You're leaving.,davos
"Yes, but not on you.",davos

You must keep the coast on your left side until you reach King's Landing.,davos

I'd worry more about the Red Woman.,davos
The other way.,davos
You ever been in a boat before?,davos

"I don't know, Your Grace. I can't see the future in the fire.",davos
"Very well, Ser Davos Seaworth. I, Stannis of the House Baratheon, First of My Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, sentence you to die.",stannis baratheon

Why am I gonna need you?,stannis baratheon
"It's from Maester Aemon of the Night's Watch. Their Lord Commander is dead. Took a ranging party north and never made it back. One lad did, though. What he saw beyond the Wall- it's coming for all of us.",davos
When did you learn to read?,stannis baratheon
Matthos taught me before he died so I could be of better service to you.,davos

It's all right. These people won't hurt me.,daenerys targaryen
Fly.,daenerys targaryen
Let me pass,daenerys targaryen
Magnificent.,jaime lannister
Mm-hmm.,tywin lannister
Looks fresh-forged.,jaime lannister
It is.,tywin lannister
No one's made a Valyrian steel sword since the Doom of Valyria.,jaime lannister
There are three living smiths who know how to rework Valyrian steel. The finest of them was in Volantis. Came here to King's Landing at my invitation.,tywin lannister
Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?,jaime lannister
From someone who no longer had need of it.,tywin lannister
You've wanted one of these in the family for a long time.,jaime lannister
And now we have two.,tywin lannister
Two?,jaime lannister
The original weapon was absurdly large. Plenty of steel for two swords.,tywin lannister
"Well, thank you. It's glorious.",jaime lannister
You'll have to train your left hand.,tywin lannister
Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands.,jaime lannister
You'll never be as good.,tywin lannister
"No. But as long as I'm better than everyone else, I suppose it doesn't matter.",jaime lannister
You can't serve in the Kingsguard with one hand.,tywin lannister
Where's that written? I can and I will. The Kingsguard oath is for life.,jaime lannister
The war is over. The king is safe. The king is never safe.,tywin lannister
How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike?,jaime lannister
Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner. They will continue to do so when you go home.,tywin lannister
Home?,jaime lannister
You'll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead.,tywin lannister
You are the Lord of Casterly Rock.,jaime lannister
I am the King's Hand. My place is here. I don't expect to see the Rock again before I die.,tywin lannister
You know what they call me? Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. Man without honor. Now you want me to break another sacred vow.,jaime lannister
You won't be breaking anything. There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties. The king will exercise that prerogative.,tywin lannister
No.,jaime lannister
No?,tywin lannister
I don't believe I asked you a question.,tywin lannister
There's my answer.,jaime lannister
If you think your bloody honor comes before...,tywin lannister
"My bloody honor is beyond repair, but my answer is still no. I don't want Casterly Rock. I don't want a wife. I don't want children.",jaime lannister
What do you want?,tywin lannister
Supper would be nice.,jaime lannister
"For 40 years I've tried to teach you. If you haven't learned by now, you never will. Go. If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition, go serve.",tywin lannister
I suppose you want the sword back.,jaime lannister
Keep it.,tywin lannister
A one-handed man with no family needs all the help he can get.,tywin lannister
How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat?,bronn
Please don't.,tyrion lannister
"Seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern. That way, one party is late, the other party can drink some ale inside.",bronn
"This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends.",tyrion lannister
"If he's so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?",bronn
There's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Has been for years.,tyrion lannister
"And just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood, it may as well be yours, eh?",bronn
No need for cynicism. I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.,tyrion lannister
Oh.,bronn
"Ah, here we are.",tyrion lannister
Can you read the sigils?,tyrion lannister
Yellow balls?,bronn
Boy knows his Dornish Houses.,tyrion lannister
I need a sigil.,bronn
"And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?",tyrion lannister
"Well met, my lords. His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name. My lord father, the King's Hand, sends his greetings as well. I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock, Master of Coin. Forgive me. I don't see Prince Doran in your company.",tyrion lannister
"Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast.",tyrion lannister
And where is Prince Oberyn?,tyrion lannister
"Very well. My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep.",tyrion lannister
You must be weary after such a long journey.,tyrion lannister
Some accomplished diplomacy that was. Now where?,bronn
We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies.,tyrion lannister
How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?,bronn
"You're famous for fucking half of Westeros. You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go?",tyrion lannister
"I'd probably go to sleep, but I'm getting old.",bronn
"Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion. We heard there might be...",tyrion lannister
trouble.,tyrion lannister
I'm here to welcome you to the capital.,tyrion lannister
If there's anything I can do to make your stay...,tyrion lannister
"It started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight.",bronn
"Killed the right people, I suppose.",bronn
"Oh, I partook. Now I'm married.",tyrion lannister
"Prince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private?",tyrion lannister
"Oh, they take all kinds.",tyrion lannister
The king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding.,tyrion lannister
"Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult.",tyrion lannister
"Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?",tyrion lannister
I thought we were speaking truth.,tyrion lannister
I wasn't actually present.,tyrion lannister
I've heard rumors.,tyrion lannister
I wasn't there. I don't know what happened.,tyrion lannister
"They're dragons, Khaleesi. They can never be tamed. Not even by their mother.",jorah mormont

Where's Daario Naharis? Where's Grey Worm?,daenerys targaryen
Gambling?,daenerys targaryen
How long have they been at it?,daenerys targaryen
What's the prize to winning this stupid contest?,daenerys targaryen
That honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan as neither of them kept me waiting this morning. You two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock.,daenerys targaryen
The last man holding his sword can find a new queen to fight for.,daenerys targaryen
"No, thank you.",sansa stark
"My lady, you do need to eat.",tyrion lannister
I don't need to eat.,sansa stark
If I could have a moment alone with my wife.,tyrion lannister
I can't let you starve.,tyrion lannister
I swore to protect you.,tyrion lannister
"My lady, I am your husband. Let me help you.",tyrion lannister
How can you help me?,sansa stark
"I don't know, but I can try.",tyrion lannister
I lie awake all night staring at the canopy thinking about how they died.,sansa stark
I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep.,tyrion lannister
Do you know what they did to my brother? How they sewed his direwolf's head onto his body? And my mother. They say they cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river.,sansa stark
"What happened to your family was a terrible crime. I didn't know your brother. He seemed like a good man, but I didn't know him. Your mother, on the other hand, I admired her. She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her. She was a strong woman. And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children. Sansa. Your mother would want you to carry on. You know it's true.",tyrion lannister
"Will you pardon me, my lord? I'd like to visit the godswood.",sansa stark
"Of course. Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear.",tyrion lannister
I don't pray anymore. It's the only place I can go where people don't talk to me.,sansa stark
What are you doing?,tyrion lannister
How many times have I told you? You can't visit me here.,tyrion lannister
Of course I haven't forgotten.,tyrion lannister
Things are a bit tense right now.,tyrion lannister
My nephew the king wants to murder me. My wife hates me because my father murdered her family. Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister.,tyrion lannister
I told you. It's not a good time.,tyrion lannister
Shae.,tyrion lannister
Love her? I barely know her. She's a child. She despises me.,tyrion lannister
Of course I don't love her.,tyrion lannister
Ship you away?,tyrion lannister
What in the world are you talking about?,tyrion lannister
Shh. I don't know what you're talking about.,tyrion lannister
"You like it so much, you're welcome to chop off your own hand and take it.",jaime lannister
Such an ingrate. I spent days with the goldsmith - getting the details just right.,cersei lannister
Days?,jaime lannister
"Better part of an afternoon. There, how does that feel?",cersei lannister
Uh... a hook would be more practical.,jaime lannister
"Elegant, I think.",cersei lannister
Thank you for your help with the other matter.,cersei lannister
"Gone completely. I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn.",cersei lannister
Odd little man.,jaime lannister
"I've grown rather fond of him. He's quite talented, you know?",cersei lannister
What symptoms?,jaime lannister
Symptoms that are not your concern.,cersei lannister
You let him touch you?,jaime lannister
You jealous?,cersei lannister
I'm surprised. You never let Pycelle near you.,jaime lannister
You think I'd let that old lecher put his hands on me? He smells like a dead cat.,cersei lannister
I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.,jaime lannister
"Well, they smell like Pycelle.",cersei lannister
You drink more than you used to.,jaime lannister
Yes.,cersei lannister
Why?,jaime lannister
"Let's see, you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital. My husband died in a tragic hunting accident.",cersei lannister
It must have been traumatic for you.,jaime lannister
My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne. We suffered through a siege.,cersei lannister
A rather short siege.,jaime lannister
"A rather short siege that I didn't expect to survive. And now I'm marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden while I'm supposed to marry her brother, a renowned pillow biter. So...",cersei lannister
Father disowned me today.,jaime lannister
He can't disown you. You're all he's got.,cersei lannister
You're forgetting Tyrion.,jaime lannister
"You don't really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you?",cersei lannister
Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you.,jaime lannister
Not now.,cersei lannister
I want... Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.,jaime lannister
Something's changed.,jaime lannister
Everything's changed. You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same?,cersei lannister
What do you want me to apologize for?,jaime lannister
For leaving me.,cersei lannister
You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?,jaime lannister
Don't know what you wanted. You weren't here. You left me alone.,cersei lannister
"Every day I was a prisoner, I plotted my escape. Every day. I murdered people so I could be here with you.",jaime lannister
You took too long.,cersei lannister
I... What are you saying?,jaime lannister
I'm saying you took too long.,cersei lannister
Come in.,cersei lannister
Go away.,jaime lannister
"Last time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell. ""He said, "" Next time I see you, you'll be all in black."" I was jealous of Robb my whole life. The way my father looked at him, I wanted that. He was better than me at everything... fighting and hunting and riding and girls. Gods, the girls loved him. I wanted to hate him, but I never could.",jon snow
Sometimes I want to hate you.,sam
"Well, you're better than me at everything. Except reading.",sam
They're... they're ready for you.,sam
He's wanted to hang me for a while. Now's his chance.,jon snow
No one's going to hang you. You've done nothing wrong.,sam
I've done plenty wrong.,jon snow
I didn't murder him.,jon snow
He wanted me to kill him.,jon snow
The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.,jon snow
"Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him...",jon snow
"Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl.",jon snow
I do.,jon snow
"While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000.",jon snow
"100,000. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans. He has giants fighting for him.",jon snow
"Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?",jon snow
And now you're here. You must not have been very good at your job.,jon snow
There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth.,jon snow
Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?,jon snow
"No. No. You're a queen, not an ox.",olenna tyrell
Your grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my 51st nameday.,olenna tyrell
Nonsense.,olenna tyrell
"My little dears. Go and speak to the jewelers of King's Landing. Tell them who you are, tell them who sent you. The one who brings me the best necklace will get to keep the next best.",olenna tyrell
"The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the sept a fortnight from now will inspire 1,000 songs. Now, how sad it will be if she's wearing rubbish like that.",olenna tyrell
"You watch that. Even here, even with me.",olenna tyrell
My word.,olenna tyrell
My lady. My lady. Please pardon me for interrupting. My name is Brienne of Tarth.,brienne
We know who you are. We've heard all about you. But hearing is one thing. Aren't you just marvelous? Absolutely singular.,olenna tyrell
I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt like the silly little boy he is.,olenna tyrell
"My lady, I know this is a very busy time for you, but if I could just have a moment.",brienne
You dare not refuse.,olenna tyrell
"A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I swear to you by all the gods it was Stannis. He plunged his sword through Renly's heart and disappeared. One day, my lady, I will avenge our king.",brienne
I meant no offense.,brienne
"All the Kingsguard will be on duty, of course. Ser Boros will be stationed here. Ser Preston will be stationed here beside the primary entertainment. Your Grace?",jaime lannister
Ser Meryn will guard Lady Margaery and Tommen.,jaime lannister
"And I thank you for it, Ser Meryn. All very good. I don't expect any trouble.",jaime lannister
"Margaery Tyrell, I've heard.",jaime lannister
The war's not won. Not while Stannis lives.,jaime lannister
"My apologies, Your Grace. I was rather busy.",jaime lannister
"So this is the famous ""Book of Brothers""? All the great deeds of all the great Kingsguard. Ser Arthur Dayne. The Sword of the Morning. Led the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood. Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat. Ser Duncan the Tall. Four pages for Ser Duncan. He must have been quite a man.",jaime lannister
So they say.,jaime lannister
There's still time.,jaime lannister
"I use my left hand now, Your Grace. Makes for more of a contest.",jaime lannister
Have you ever been to Meereen?,daenerys targaryen
And?,daenerys targaryen
And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates. You think the Great Masters are worried?,daenerys targaryen
You were told to ride at the back of the train.,daenerys targaryen
"All right, what is this matter of strategy?",daenerys targaryen
Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding?,daenerys targaryen
Would you like to walk without shoes?,daenerys targaryen
"You are a gambler, aren't you?",daenerys targaryen
There's one on every mile marker between here and Meereen.,jorah mormont
How many miles are there between here and Meereen?,daenerys targaryen
You will do no such thing. I will see each and every one of their faces. Remove her collar before you bury her.,daenerys targaryen
There she is.,brienne
"Yes, there she is.",jaime lannister
And? You made a promise.,brienne
To return the Stark girls to their mother who is now dead.,jaime lannister
To keep them safe.,brienne
"Well, Arya Stark hasn't been seen since her father was killed. Where do you think she is? My money's on dead. There's a certain safety in death, wouldn't you say? And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister. Bit of a complication.",jaime lannister
A complication does not release you from a vow.,brienne
What do you want me to do? Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her where? Where would she be safer than here?,jaime lannister
Look me in the eye and tell me that you think she'll be safe in King's Landing.,brienne
"Are you sure we're not related? Ever since I've returned, every Lannister I've seen has been a miserable pain in my ass. Maybe you're a Lannister, too. You've got the hair for it if not the looks.",jaime lannister
You're drunk.,sansa stark
Ser Dontos. The king's nameday celebration. I'm sorry. I should have remembered.,sansa stark
Anyone would have done the same.,sansa stark
"I can't take it. It's very, very kind of you, but I can't.",sansa stark
"I'll wear it with pride, Ser Dontos.",sansa stark
When am I going to get a horse of my own?,arya stark
The little lady wants away from your stench.,arya stark
Why don't you have any money? Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey before you left?,arya stark
"You're not very smart, are you?",arya stark
"You're fine with murdering little boys, but thieving is beneath you?",arya stark
You think I'm gonna escape? Where would I go? I'd be dead by nightfall without you. My family's gone. I've got no one.,arya stark
I'm hungry. You're hungry.,arya stark
I know him. The small one. His name is Polliver. He captured us and took us to Harrenhal.,arya stark
He killed Lommy.,arya stark
He was my friend. Polliver stole my sword and put it right through his neck. He's still got it.,arya stark
My sword Needle.,arya stark
Lots of people name their swords.,arya stark
My brother gave me that sword.,arya stark
He killed my friend.,arya stark
"Something wrong with your leg, boy?",arya stark
Can you walk? I've got to carry you?,arya stark
Fine little blade.,arya stark
Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.,arya stark
"A fine shot, master. My lady.",theon greyjoy
"Your new hand, it's nicer than the old one. Wouldn't you agree, Pod?",tyrion lannister
Gilded steel.,jaime lannister
You're not eating. Why is no one eating? My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself.,tyrion lannister
I'm not hungry.,jaime lannister
"You lost a hand, not a stomach. Try the boar. Cersei can't get enough of it since one killed Robert for her.",tyrion lannister
"A toast. To the proud Lannister children. The dwarf, the cripple, and the mother of madness.",tyrion lannister
Oh!,jaime lannister
"No, I'll do it. Leave us.",jaime lannister
It's only wine.,tyrion lannister
I can't fight anymore.,jaime lannister
What about your left?,tyrion lannister
"I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong. How can I protect the king when I can hardly wipe my own ass?",jaime lannister
You're the Lord Commander now. Command. Let others do the fighting. When was the last time Father used a sword?,tyrion lannister
I'm not Father. I'm the Kingslayer. When people find out I can't slay a pigeon...,jaime lannister
"Train, then. Learn to fight with your other hand.",tyrion lannister
"With whom? You? Men talk. Soon as someone discovers I can't fight, he'll tell everyone.",jaime lannister
"You need a proper, discreet swordsman. As it happens, I have just the one.",tyrion lannister
My brother tells me you can keep your mouth shut. Unusual talent for a sellsword.,jaime lannister
He tells me you shit gold just like your father.,bronn
Is this place safe?,jaime lannister
"There's this knight, Leygood, got thunderbolts on his shield.",bronn
Uh-huh.,jaime lannister
"Right here is where I fuck his wife. She's a screamer, that one. If they don't hear her, they won't hear us.",bronn
"I've never seen Valyrian steel before. She's a beauty. The problem is, if you fight with an edged blade, I'll have to.",bronn

Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the king?,tyrion lannister
I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome at such exclusive affairs.,varys
"Oh, to be foreign.",tyrion lannister
Ahem.,varys
Shae has been noticed. Sansa's maid saw you with her. She already told your sister. It's only a matter of time before your father hears.,varys
So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden. My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie.,tyrion lannister
"No, I will not. How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying? I have no pet sellsword to protect me. No legendary brother to avenge me. Only little birds who whisper in my ear.",varys
Forgive me if I don't weep for you.,tyrion lannister
No one weeps for spiders or whores. I have friends across the sea who could help her.,varys
"She won't leave. I've told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it.",tyrion lannister
Your father has promised to hang the next whore he finds you with. Have you ever known your father to make an idle threat?,varys
She's the whore I told you about. The dark-haired one.,cersei lannister
Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand before the wedding.,tywin lannister
"The Lives of Four Kings."" Grand Maester Kaeth's history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good. A book every king should read.",tyrion lannister
"One of only two Valyrian steel swords in the capital, Your Grace, freshly forged in your honor.",tywin lannister
Don't.,tyrion lannister
Don't call me that.,tyrion lannister
I'm afraid our friendship can't continue.,tyrion lannister
There's a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos.,tyrion lannister
"You'll have your own cabin, of course, and, across the Narrow Sea, a house, servants.",tyrion lannister
"I'm a married man. My wife has suffered a great deal, as you well know. I don't want her to suffer anymore on my account. I need to uphold my vows.",tyrion lannister
I need to do right by her.,tyrion lannister
By our children.,tyrion lannister
I'm not afraid.,tyrion lannister
I need you to leave.,tyrion lannister
Shae.,tyrion lannister
You're a whore! Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are not. I can't be in love with a whore. I can't have children with a whore. How many men have you been with? Five hundred? Five thousand?,tyrion lannister
I have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all. But now that time is over.,tyrion lannister
You'll have a comfortable life in Pentos. Bronn will escort you to your ship.,tyrion lannister
Lord Florent was your brother by law.,davos
He was an infidel.,stannis baratheon
"He worshipped the gods of his fathers and their fathers before him. They were the gods of your fathers, too.",davos
I ordered him to tear down his idols. He disobeyed.,stannis baratheon
How many ships did he bring to your 'cause? How many men?,davos
A good deal more than you.,stannis baratheon
"I'm sure they're more than grateful, my queen.",davos
Meat's off.,stannis baratheon
"Serve fish, then. We're on an island.",stannis baratheon
"I hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same.",stannis baratheon
Of course I remember.,stannis baratheon
She's a child.,stannis baratheon
She's my daughter. You will not strike her.,stannis baratheon
He saw us.,cersei lannister
We have a new queen.,sansa stark
Better her than you.,tyrion lannister
"Bit much, wouldn't you say?",tywin lannister
It feels proportionate.,olenna tyrell
Proportionate to what?,tywin lannister
The expected extravagance.,olenna tyrell
People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long.,tywin lannister
You ought to try enjoying something before you die. You might find it suits you.,olenna tyrell
"Not now, Mace. Lord Tywin and I are speaking.",olenna tyrell
"Anyway, I don't know what you're complaining about. I'm paying my share.",olenna tyrell
Shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity?,tywin lannister
"No, your heartfelt thank you is its own reward. I would imagine I'd be hearing it again before long. Wars are rather expensive. ""The Iron Bank will have it's due."" How they love to remind everyone. Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts.",olenna tyrell
I'm not worried about the Iron Bank.,tywin lannister
"We both know you're smarter than that. Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love.",olenna tyrell
All taken care of.,bronn
You saw her board the ship?,tyrion lannister
"Aye, she's on it.",bronn
You saw the ship sail away?,tyrion lannister
"No one knows she's there but you, me, and Varys.",bronn
How do you know?,tyrion lannister
"Because if someone follows me without an invitation, I'm the last person they ever follow.",bronn
There's someone following you?,tyrion lannister
"She's gone. I know you don't want to believe it, but she is. Now, go drink till it feels like you did the right thing.",bronn
Hello.,tyrion lannister
"You look exquisite, child. The wind has been at you, though. I haven't had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother. War is war, but killing a man at a wedding, horrid. What sort of monster would do such a thing? As if men need more reasons to fear marriage.",olenna tyrell
My lady. My lady.,tyrion lannister
"Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that. Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit. Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it. You must excuse me. It's time I ate some of this food I paid for.",olenna tyrell
You're an example to us all.,cersei lannister
"Ser Loras, it's quite all right. Your sister looks very beautiful.",jaime lannister
"So, looking forward to your wedding?",jaime lannister
Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect.,jaime lannister
"Perhaps they should get married. If you were to marry Cersei, she'd murder you in your sleep. If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, she'd murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath. Luckily for you, none of this will happen because you'll never marry her.",jaime lannister
Your Grace. My king. My queen.,brienne
"I'm no lady, Your Grace.",brienne
Did you just bow?,cersei lannister
"Apologies, Your Grace. I never did master the curtsy.",brienne
I just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune. The country has been at war too long. I hope your reign is long and peaceful.,brienne
Lady Brienne. You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter. That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not.,cersei lannister
"As you say, Your Grace.",brienne
I owe you my gratitude. You returned my brother safely to King's Landing.,cersei lannister
"In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace. More than once.",brienne
Did he? Haven't heard that story before.,cersei lannister
"Not such a fascinating story, I'm afraid.",brienne
I'm sure you have many fascinating stories. Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother. Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.,cersei lannister
"I don't serve your brother, Your Grace.",brienne
But you love him.,cersei lannister
Your Grace.,brienne
She'll do no such thing.,cersei lannister
You should see Qyburn. He's quite good.,cersei lannister
More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?,cersei lannister
My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him. What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me?,cersei lannister
But you are. You annoy me right now. Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me. So here's what I want you to do. I want you to leave my presence. Leave this wedding right now. Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.,cersei lannister
The queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will.,cersei lannister
You're in rather a good mood.,tywin lannister
I suppose I am.,cersei lannister
I won't ask why.,tywin lannister
Small pleasures.,cersei lannister
Prince Oberyn.,tywin lannister
Charmed.,tywin lannister
Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.,cersei lannister
No? How tolerant of you.,cersei lannister
"I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn. It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding.",cersei lannister
"Please give him our regards. With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again.",tywin lannister
Noblemen in my part of the country don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.,tywin lannister
Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done.,tyrion lannister
We'll have to find another way to thank the king.,tyrion lannister
"One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace. I would like to keep what remains of my face. I think you should fight him. This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. This one is clearly mad with lust. It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night.",tyrion lannister
A fine vintage. Shame that it spilled.,tyrion lannister
Your Grace does me a great honor.,tyrion lannister
Can we leave now?,sansa stark
Let's find out.,tyrion lannister
"I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace.",tyrion lannister
"If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired.",tyrion lannister
Your Grace?,tyrion lannister
Help the poor boy.,olenna tyrell
"Idiots, help your king.",olenna tyrell
Move away!,jaime lannister
Joffrey! Joffrey!,jaime lannister
Help him! Someone help him!,cersei lannister
Joffrey!,cersei lannister
Joffrey! Joffrey!,cersei lannister
Don't touch him!,cersei lannister
"Joffrey. Please, Joffrey. Joffrey, what is it? Help him!",cersei lannister
My son.,cersei lannister
"He did this. He poisoned my son, your king. Take him. Take him! Take him! Take him!",cersei lannister
You did this. You did this!,cersei lannister
Take him! Take him!,cersei lannister
Where is his wife? Where's Sansa?,cersei lannister
Find her. Bar the gates of the city. Seize every ship in the harbor.,tywin lannister
Where is she?!,cersei lannister
No one leaves the capital! No one!,tywin lannister
Where are we going?,sansa stark
Lord Baelish?,sansa stark
"Petyr... Are you hurt, my lady?",petyr baelish
Good. Good. I'm sure you've had quite a fright. Rest easy. The worst is past. Ser Dontos shouts up from his boat.,petyr baelish
"Softly, my friend... Voices carry over water.",petyr baelish
"Shh. You don't want the queen to hear, do you? 1,000 gold cloaks are searching for you. And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?",petyr baelish
I didn't murder anyone.,sansa stark
"I know. I know. But you must admit it looks suspicious. The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder.",petyr baelish
Why did you kill him?,sansa stark
Because he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools.,petyr baelish
He saved me.,sansa stark
"Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders. Every one of them. And he did it all for gold. Money buys a man's silence for a time. A bolt in the heart buys it forever.",petyr baelish
He was helping me because I saved his life.,sansa stark
"Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother. The last legacy of House Hollard.",petyr baelish
I had it made a few weeks ago. What did I once tell you about the capital?,petyr baelish
We're all liars here.,sansa stark
"Come, my lady. I know you've had a difficult day. But you're safe now. I promise you that. You're safe with me and sailing home.",petyr baelish
"More than you were with Renly. Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying. In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue.",olenna tyrell
"The world is overflowing with horrible things. But they're all a tray of cakes next to death. They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know? Made me look at it.",olenna tyrell
They took me to the Great Hall and there he was. The man I'd married and suffered to father my children. A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings. There he was... lying on a table.,olenna tyrell
"Nonsense. Your circumstances have improved markedly. You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that.",olenna tyrell
Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us. You did wonderful work on Joffrey. The next one should be easier.,olenna tyrell
Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means?,tywin lannister
I'm not trying to trick you.,tywin lannister
"Yes, you will become king. What kind of king do you think you'll be?",tywin lannister
"Mm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?",tywin lannister
This is hardly the place or the time.,cersei lannister
Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.,tywin lannister
Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?,tywin lannister
No.,tywin lannister
"Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?",tywin lannister
Yes!,tywin lannister
Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?,tywin lannister
"No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?",tywin lannister
"Yes, but why? To further the family line. Do you know how that happens?",tywin lannister
"Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?",tywin lannister
How are you?,jaime lannister
You are. You will be. I'll see to that.,jaime lannister
Please give the queen a moment alone with her son.,jaime lannister
"It was Tyrion. He killed him. He told me he would. ""A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth."" That's what he said to me. You saw it. You saw Joff point at him just before he...",cersei lannister
I don't know what I saw.,jaime lannister
Avenge him. Avenge our son. Kill Tyrion.,cersei lannister
Tyrion's my brother. Our brother. There'll be a trial. We'll get to the truth of what happened.,jaime lannister
"I don't want a trial. He'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance. I want him dead. Please, Jaime. You have to. He was our son. Our baby boy.",cersei lannister
You're a hateful woman. Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?,jaime lannister
"Jaime, not here, please. Please.",cersei lannister
Stop it. Stop it. Stop.,cersei lannister
No.,jaime lannister
Stop it. Stop.,cersei lannister
Stop. Stop. It's not right.,cersei lannister
It's not right. It's not right.,cersei lannister
I don't care.,jaime lannister
Don't.,cersei lannister
"Don't. Jaime, don't.",cersei lannister
Gonna rain soon. Where are we?,arya stark
You think? You don't have a map?,arya stark
Maybe we should get one.,arya stark

On your way where?,arya stark
I'd like to see Braavos one day.,arya stark
I have friends there.,arya stark

I worry about it sometimes. All the time.,sam
"100 men, one woman.",sam
That's the only thing they think about.,sam
I'm not being silly. There's 100 men lying awake at night picturing you.,sam
What about me? Gilly? I worry about you.,sam
For what?,sam
"I don't know if you're safe here. They're my brothers, but some of them were thieves before they came here. Some of them were rapers. You saw what they did at your father's keep.",sam
Maybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town.,sam
Bored of you? I... I want to protect you.,sam
Your Grace.,davos
You're a literary man now. What do you make of that?,stannis baratheon
Joffrey?,davos
The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire. A leech filled with bastard blood. A bastard you set free. I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it.,stannis baratheon
"I will find you an army, Your Grace. I've been working day and night...",davos
What progress have you made?,stannis baratheon
I've rallied House Peasebury to your 'cause.,davos
House Peasebury.,stannis baratheon
House Musgood.,davos
House Musgood.,stannis baratheon
And House Haigh.,davos
House Haigh. They don't have enough men between them to raid a pantry.,stannis baratheon
"Westeros is not the world, Your Grace. We need to look east for ships and men. 10,000 skilled soldiers fight for the Golden Company.",davos
The Golden Company?,stannis baratheon
They've never broken a contract.,davos
They're sellswords.,stannis baratheon
"We're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but we're not willing to pay men to fight? Now the Red Woman's magic is real. Her visions and prophecies may be, too, but I've never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war. Soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground. It's dirty on the ground.",davos
We don't have any gold.,stannis baratheon
Not yet.,davos
"If I do not press my claim, my claim will be forgotten. I will not become a page in someone else's history book. I'm running out of time, Ser Davos. Which means you're running out of time. -",stannis baratheon
"I'm sorry, Princess.",davos
The Hand of the King doesn't have much leisure time.,davos
"That happened once, weeks ago. You're your father's daughter, no mistake. Bloody relentless, the both of you.",davos
The Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas. First Sword of Braavos.,davos
Thank you very much.,davos
"No, I was never a pirate. I was a smuggler.",davos
"Well, if you're a famous smuggler, you're not doing it right.",davos
Your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior. So do the Braavosi.,davos
"Of course. Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos. I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers, but he didn't seem any more interested in the distinction than your father. I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom, you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction...",davos
I need you to write a message.,davos
It's too important for me. I need a smart person to do it. Go on.,davos
To the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos from Stannis Baratheon the one true king of Westeros.,davos
I need to get their attention. Go on. Write.,davos
"He's seen some adventures, hasn't he?",sam
That's right. She'll clean and cook and look after the other girls' babies.,sam
No other work.,sam
I promise to come back and visit whenever I can. You'll be safer here. Who's gonna protect you at Castle Black? Me?,sam
"This is different. They're brothers of the Night's Watch and I can't just stab them in the back and I can't run away, which is what we did at Craster's.",sam
You have to trust me. It's for the best.,sam
"Oh, Gilly. Please don't.",sam
Prince Oberyn.,tywin lannister
May we have the room?,tywin lannister
"No, thank you.",tywin lannister
Are you?,tywin lannister
Which way is that?,tywin lannister
Some believe the king choked.,tywin lannister
I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.,tywin lannister
"Your hatred for my family is rather well known. You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning, some days later my grandson dies of poisoning.",tywin lannister
You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived. What did you discuss?,tywin lannister
What did you discuss?,tywin lannister
For which you blame me.,tywin lannister
"Here I stand unarmed, unguarded. Should I be concerned?",tywin lannister
Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors' knowledge.,tywin lannister
Categorically.,tywin lannister
I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.,tywin lannister
I could arrange for this meeting.,tywin lannister
"There will be a trial for my son. And as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict. I will preside. Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge. I would like you to be the third.",tywin lannister
"Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon. Declared themselves enemies of the throne. Now they are our strongest allies.",tywin lannister
I will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors.,tywin lannister
"We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold. The king is dead. The Greyjoys are in open rebellion. A wildling army marches on the Wall. And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons. Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros. Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons.",tywin lannister
We need each other. You help me serve justice to the king's assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.,tywin lannister
Podrick. Apologies for the stench.,tyrion lannister
A noble effort.,tyrion lannister
You're a good lad. Any word of Shae?,tyrion lannister
I suppose that's a good thing. What are they saying about me out there?,tyrion lannister
Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?,tyrion lannister
"No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet?",tyrion lannister
Of course.,tyrion lannister
Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.,tyrion lannister
Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.,tyrion lannister
"Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa.",tyrion lannister
Gone?,tyrion lannister
"No one had more 'cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick.",tyrion lannister
They'll be following you now.,tyrion lannister
"I don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go.",tyrion lannister
Varys could vouch for me if he dared.,tyrion lannister
Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.,tyrion lannister
Why not?,tyrion lannister
And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?,tyrion lannister
Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?,tyrion lannister
Are you going to accept their offer?,tyrion lannister
"Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet.",tyrion lannister
"Pod, the trial's in a fortnight. They'll want an answer before that.",tyrion lannister
"I will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted.",tyrion lannister
"Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late. Pod! This is farewell.",tyrion lannister
Pod. There has never lived a more loyal squire.,tyrion lannister
"Mance Rayder is coming. If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them.",jon snow
Help him.,jon snow
And the mutineers stayed?,jon snow
We need to ride north and kill them all.,jon snow
"It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them.",jon snow
Are they attacking?,daenerys targaryen
A single rider. A champion of Meereen. They want you to send your own champion against him.,jorah mormont
What is he doing?,daenerys targaryen
They're not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them.,jorah mormont
"I have something to say to the people of Meereen. First, I will need this one to be quiet. Do I have a champion?",daenerys targaryen
You are the commander of the Unsullied. I cannot risk you.,daenerys targaryen
Which is why you must remain by my side.,daenerys targaryen
"I've been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi. Let me stand for you today as well.",jorah mormont
"You are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend. I will not gamble with your life.",daenerys targaryen
Very well. You have quite an audience. Make it worth their while.,daenerys targaryen
"Yes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching.",daenerys targaryen
You sure you don't want a horse?,daenerys targaryen
Horses are faster than men.,daenerys targaryen
I am Daenerys Stormborn.,daenerys targaryen
"Your Masters may have told you lies about me, or they may have told you nothing. It does not matter. I have nothing to say to them. Only to you. First I went to Astapor. Those who were slaves in Astapor now stand behind me, free. Next I went to Yunkai. Those who were slaves in Yunkai now stand behind me, free. Now I have come to Meereen. I am not your enemy. Your enemy is beside you.",daenerys targaryen
Your enemy steals and murders your children. Your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands. I do not bring commands. I bring you a choice. And I bring your enemies what they deserve. Forward!,daenerys targaryen
Fire!,daenerys targaryen
How are the lessons coming?,daenerys targaryen
You'll have to continue later. It's time.,daenerys targaryen
"Remind me, Ser Jorah, how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts?",daenerys targaryen
"163, Khaleesi.",jorah mormont
"Yes, that was it.",daenerys targaryen
I will answer injustice with justice.,daenerys targaryen
What the hell was that?,jaime lannister
That was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand.,bronn
"You're a rare talent. When you're fighting cripples, anyway.",jaime lannister
You learned to fight like a good little boy. I'll bet that thrust through the MadKing's back was pretty as a picture. You want to fight pretty or you want to win?,bronn
You talk to my brother this way?,jaime lannister
All the time. He got used to it.,bronn
Do you think he did it?,jaime lannister
"No. Oh, he hated the little twat, sure. But who didn't? And poison's not his style. Or murder, for that matter. You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?",bronn
"You haven't been to see him yet, eh?",bronn
We're done for today.,jaime lannister
Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?,bronn
You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.,jaime lannister
Aye. But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day. You were his first choice. He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him. You gonna fight for him now?,bronn
"To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad. Four walls. A pot to piss in. I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months.",jaime lannister
Is that supposed to make me feel better?,tyrion lannister
Maybe a bit. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.,jaime lannister
"It's complicated, yes. So how is our sister?",tyrion lannister
How do you think? Her son died in her arms.,jaime lannister
Her son?,tyrion lannister
Don't. You know what's coming?,jaime lannister
"My trial for regicide.Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed.",tyrion lannister
"Now that you mention it, she did ask.",jaime lannister
"So, should I turn around and close my eyes?",tyrion lannister
Depends. Did you do it?,jaime lannister
The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You're really asking if I killed your son?,tyrion lannister
Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother? How can I help you?,jaime lannister
"Well, you could set me free.",tyrion lannister
You know I can't.,jaime lannister
Then there's really nothing else to say.,tyrion lannister
What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.,jaime lannister
"Sorry, I'd forgotten. I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate.",tyrion lannister
Inappropriate? You're accused of killing the king.Freeing you is treason.,jaime lannister
Except I didn't do it.,tyrion lannister
"Which is why we're having a trial. A trial. If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei. She won't rest until my heado s on a spike.",jaime lannister
Not just yours. She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.,jaime lannister
Sansa couldn't have done this. She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?,tyrion lannister
"No, but... Sansa's not a killer. Not yet, anyway.",tyrion lannister
Where are you taking me?,sansa stark
I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa. She's waiting for us at the Eyrie. You'll be safe there.,petyr baelish
Did you kill Joffrey?,sansa stark
Did I kill Joffrey? I've been in the Vale for weeks.,petyr baelish
I know it was you.,sansa stark
And who helped me with this conspiracy?,petyr baelish
"Well, there was Ser Dontos. You used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king.",sansa stark
Why not?,petyr baelish
Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.,sansa stark
Then perhaps it was your husband.,petyr baelish
No.,sansa stark
How do you know?,petyr baelish
I just do.,sansa stark
You're right. He wasn't involvedi n Joffrey's death. But you were. Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you? I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.,petyr baelish
"The poison. I don't understand. The Lannisters gave you wealth, power. Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal.",sansa stark
"A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next.",petyr baelish
"I don't believe you. If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's. You'd risk that just to confuse them?",sansa stark
So many men they risk so little. They spend their lives avoiding danger. And then they die. I'd risk everything to get what I want.,petyr baelish
And what do you want?,sansa stark
"Everything. My friendship with the Lannisters was productive. But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally. And who could trust a friend like that?",petyr baelish
Who could trust you?,sansa stark
"I don't want friends like me. My new friends are predictable. Very reasonable people. As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly. Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong.",petyr baelish
"The time has come, my dear. There's nothing more tedious than a trial. Except perhaps these gardens. If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs.",olenna tyrell
Have you been to see Tommen yet?,olenna tyrell
"I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know. He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola. I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the momentI saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do. So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber.",olenna tyrell
How absentminded of me.,olenna tyrell
"The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk.",olenna tyrell
"And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before. I was good. I was very, very good. You are even better. But you need to act quickly. Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid. She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can. And by the time you're married, it'll be too late. Luckily for you ,the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy. Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit.",olenna tyrell
"He could have done,but he didn't.",olenna tyrell
"But I do know. You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?",olenna tyrell
Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that. You just do what needs to be done.,olenna tyrell
Bring it through! And again.,jon snow
Very nice. Good.,jon snow
A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.,jon snow
Let's see what you can do.,jon snow
"Olly, you just watch for now.",jon snow
Have you ever held a sword before? OLLY I was the best archer in our hamlet.,jon snow
"You two. Take it slow, try and disarm each other.",jon snow
You know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him.,jon snow
Grenn and I were helping them.,jon snow
Someone has to train them.,jon snow
My father was highborn. My mother wasn't.,jon snow
Jon Snow.,jon snow
You fight well.,jon snow
"You sent for me, Your Grace?",jaime lannister
Your Grace. How formal of you. How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door?,cersei lannister
Ser Boros is on duty tonight. Tomorrow I believe...,jaime lannister
So one? You have one man guarding the future king?,cersei lannister
I promise you Tommen's safe. We're protecting him.,jaime lannister
The way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?,cersei lannister
What?,jaime lannister
I've been wondering for months. Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital. Why did she set you free?,cersei lannister
You know why. She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.,jaime lannister
She hoped or did you promise?,cersei lannister
"I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her.",jaime lannister
So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.,cersei lannister
I wanted to get back to you. Should I have told hert o fuck off?,jaime lannister
"You didn't mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?",cersei lannister
"Catelyn Stark's dead. So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?",jaime lannister
I know you went to see Tyrion. That creature who murdered our son.,cersei lannister
I had to see him. I had to know for myself.,jaime lannister
And?,cersei lannister
"He didn't do it, Cersei.",jaime lannister
"You've always pitied him. Our poor little brother. Abused by the world. Despised by his father and sister. He'd kill us all if he could. I want four men at Tommen's door day and night. That will be all, Lord Commander.",cersei lannister
"Ser Jaime Lannister. Knighted and named to the Kingsguard in his 16th year. At the sack of King's Landing, murdered his king Aerys II. Pardoned by Robert Baratheon. Thereafter known as the Kingslayer.",brienne
It's the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages. And there's still room left on mine.,jaime lannister
Valyrian steel.,brienne
Mmm. It's yours.,jaime lannister
I can't accept this.,brienne
"It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword. You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter. You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother. Lady Stark's dead. Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe. I've got something else for you.",jaime lannister
I hope I got your measurements right.,jaime lannister
I'll find her. For Lady Catelyn. And for you.,brienne
I almost forgot. I have one more gift.,jaime lannister
I don't need a squire.,brienne
Of course you do.,jaime lannister
He'll slow me down.,brienne
My brother owes him a debt. He's not safe here. You're keeping him from harm. It's chivalry.,jaime lannister
See? He's a good lad.You'll get along.,jaime lannister
Compliments of Lord Tyrion. His axe from the Blackwater.,bronn
"What are you waiting for, a kiss? Ready the lady's horse.",bronn
They say the best swords have names. Any ideas?,jaime lannister
Oathkeeper.,brienne
"Good-bye, Brienne.",jaime lannister
I should neverhave taken her away.,sam
She wasn't safe here.,jon snow
"She's not safe out there. I should have known. You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall. If they're raiding the smaller villages, Mole's Town could be next.",sam
Castle Black could be next.,jon snow
I should go back for Gilly.,sam
We have orders. No one's to leave the castle.,jon snow
I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb.,sam
"And I remember who came after me and brought me home. I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me. When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him.",jon snow
"I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me. I tried. Really, I did.",sam
How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?,jon snow
I don't know. They'd pass wildling villages. They could try to find shelter at one of them.,sam
The wildlings have joined up with Mance. Every village or sheltered place will be deserted. Except...,jon snow
Craster's? You think Bra nmight have found...,sam
"Thank you, Ser Alliser.",jon snow
"Ahem, brothers.",jon snow
"I'm going beyond the Wallto Craster's Keep. I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them. I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me?",jon snow
I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall.,jon snow
"Thank you, brothers.",jon snow
Your Grace.,varys
There he is.,cersei lannister
Long may he reign.,cersei lannister
"Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?",cersei lannister
You still mourn for Joffrey?,cersei lannister
He would have been your nightmare.,cersei lannister
"You knew exactly what he was. I did, too. You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child. Doesn't matter what they do. And what he did, it shocked me. Do you think I'm easily shocked?",cersei lannister
"The things he did shocked me. He's only a boy. A good boy. A decent boy. He always has been. Who was the last decent king, I wonder? He could be the first man who sits on that throne in fifty years to actually deserve it.",cersei lannister
He will need help... if he's going to rule well.,cersei lannister
"A mother is not enough. You're still interested in being queen, I take it?",cersei lannister
"Yes, speak to your father. I'll speak to mine.",cersei lannister
King Joffrey Baratheon is dead. Murdered at his own wedding.,jorah mormont
Who told you to take the Navy?,daenerys targaryen
So why did you do it?,daenerys targaryen
How many ships?,daenerys targaryen
How many men can they carry?,daenerys targaryen
Would that be enough to take King's Landing?,daenerys targaryen
The Lannisters have more.,jorah mormont
It's hard to say. It could be enough. But we're not fighting to make you Queen of King's Landing. Ten thousand men can't conquer Westeros.,jorah mormont
"The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have.",jorah mormont
"There's other news. From Yunkai. Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city. They've re-enslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you. And in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon who's declared himself ""His Imperial Majesty.""",jorah mormont
"Please leave me. Not you, Jorah.",daenerys targaryen
It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned.,daenerys targaryen
You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind. A boy sits on the Iron Throne. A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it. They've never been more vulnerable.,jorah mormont
You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth. I didn't listen. That all worked out well.,daenerys targaryen
How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me?,daenerys targaryen
You're a Targaryen. You're the Mother of Dragons.,jorah mormont
I need to be more than that. I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains. I will not sail for Westeros.,daenerys targaryen
"What, then?",jorah mormont
I will do what queens do. I will rule.,daenerys targaryen
Pull up your hood. A memorable shade.,petyr baelish
But how would they know?,sansa stark
You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most? Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.,petyr baelish
Is this the only way into the Eyrie?,sansa stark
"The mountains are impassable. If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate. It doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats. The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them. And the fortress they built here has never been overcome. Not once in a thousand years. Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth ten thousand.",petyr baelish
"Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece, Alayne.",petyr baelish
My lord.,petyr baelish
Oh. I have brought you a gift.,petyr baelish
My lady.,petyr baelish
"It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn. My name is Al...",sansa stark
"It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa.",sansa stark
Of course. I understand.,sansa stark
I would never say a thing.,sansa stark
"They did, and my father's.",sansa stark
Make him fly?,sansa stark
They did. They made us both. Lord Tyrion didn't want to.,sansa stark
No. We never...,sansa stark
"It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin.",sansa stark
Go. We'll speak soon.,petyr baelish
"Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive.",petyr baelish
Ought we not... inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?,petyr baelish
I do think that we could wait until...,petyr baelish
Like it was yesterday.,petyr baelish
The deed is done. Faded into nothing. Only speaking of it can make it real.,petyr baelish
"Tonight it is, then.",petyr baelish
"Let me bathe and dress for the occasion. Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately.",petyr baelish
When will the wedding take place in your mind?,tywin lannister
As soon as decency permits. After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.,cersei lannister
A fortnight?,tywin lannister
That seems reasonable.,cersei lannister
"No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no seventy-seven-course meals.",tywin lannister
And your wedding to Loras?,tywin lannister
Shortly after Tommen's.,cersei lannister
Shortly?,tywin lannister
A fortnight.,cersei lannister
I know you don't like them. I didn't like your husband. Used to pat me on the back a lot. I didn't trust him.,tywin lannister
We had that in common.,cersei lannister
You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.,tywin lannister
Then whom can we trust?,cersei lannister
Ourselves alone.,tywin lannister
The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.,tywin lannister
Robert wasn't particularly rich.,cersei lannister
Robert had me funding him. Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.,tywin lannister
I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.,cersei lannister
Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?,tywin lannister
Haven't a clue.,cersei lannister
"Go on, your best guess.",tywin lannister
"Pounds, tons, ounces?",cersei lannister
Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.,tywin lannister
That can't be.,cersei lannister
Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.,tywin lannister
Then how do we pay for anything?,cersei lannister
The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.,tywin lannister
How much?,cersei lannister
A tremendous amount.,tywin lannister
"There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement.",cersei lannister
The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank. There is no someone.,tywin lannister
Someone does work there. It is comprised of people.,cersei lannister
"And a temple is comprised of stones. One stone crumbles and another takes its place. And the temple holds its form for a thousand years or more. That's what the Iron Bank is... a temple. We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it. You can't run from them. You can't cheat them. You can't sway them with excuses. If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back. Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect.",tywin lannister
"It's for the good of the family, I understand that. I'm not sure my brothers do.",cersei lannister
"I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion. And as a mother, that is your right. But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you.",tywin lannister
I respect that. We don't need to discuss it.,cersei lannister
The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters. You've started wars to protect this family. Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future. What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?,cersei lannister
Joffrey. Cersei. Walder Frey. Meryn Trant. Tywin Lannister. The Red Woman. Beric Dondarrion. Thoros of Myr. Ilyn Payne. The Mountain.,arya stark
I can't sleep until I say the names.,arya stark
Only the ones I'm going to kill.,arya stark
"If he were here right now, what would you do?",arya stark
I'm almost done. Only one name left.,arya stark
The Hound.,arya stark
Thank you.,sansa stark
Really?,sansa stark
"My mother, fat? She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food.",sansa stark
They're delicious. Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.,sansa stark
Yes. I'm very lucky.,sansa stark
"Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful.",sansa stark
"Well, I'm half Tully. He loved your family so much.",sansa stark
No.,sansa stark
"He loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you.",sansa stark
"No, never.",sansa stark
"What? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never-",sansa stark
"Aunt Lysa, no, I-",sansa stark
Nothing. I'm a virgin.,sansa stark
You're hurting me.,sansa stark
"I'm a virgin, I swear it. He loves you, Aunt Lysa. All he says is that I'm stupid. I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and I'm a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth. And I swear to you that he has never touched me. Not once, not ever.",sansa stark
Didn't they teach you how to ride a horse?,brienne
"Perhaps you should have stayed with him. It's not going to be a pleasant journey for you. It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather.",brienne
"Well, Lady Sansa's brother's at Castle Black. If I were her, that's where I'd go. Feel free to stop at any point.",brienne
I've made it this far in the world without a squire. I don't see why I need one now.,brienne
"I'm not a knight. And I'm not a slaver, either. I don't own you.",brienne
I am releasing you from that oath. That means you could leave.,brienne
What do you think will happen if you leave?,brienne
Practicing.,arya stark
No one's going to kill me.,arya stark
It's not fighting. It's water dancing.,arya stark
"The greatest swordsman who ever lived. Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos.",arya stark

It was not.,arya stark
Yes.,arya stark
He was killed.,arya stark

He was outnumbered.,arya stark
Syrio didn't have a sword. Or armor. Just a stick.,arya stark
Prince Oberyn. Writing letters?,cersei lannister
May I show you the gardens?,cersei lannister
"No, you couldn't.",cersei lannister
I didn't realize you were a poet.,cersei lannister
For your paramour?,cersei lannister
"You have several, don't you?",cersei lannister
Eight? Eight daughters?,cersei lannister
Beautiful name.,cersei lannister
"Perhaps that's why she's difficult. The gods love their stupid jokes, don't they?",cersei lannister
You're a prince of Dorne. A legendary fighter. A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros. But you could not save your sister. I'm a Lannister. Queen for nineteen years. Daughter of the most powerful man alive. But I could not save my son. What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?,cersei lannister
"Yes, we can avenge them.",cersei lannister
I know he did.,cersei lannister
"We'll have a trial, anyway. I haven't seen my daughter in over a year.",cersei lannister
I want to believe that. I want to believe she's happy.,cersei lannister
"Everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls. Would you bring her a gift for me? I wasn't there for her name day. I don't know when I'll see her again.",cersei lannister
The best shipwrights in King's Landing have been working on it for months. Myrcella loves the open water.,cersei lannister
Please tell her... her mother misses her very much.,cersei lannister
Did you remove the skin?,brienne
Have you ever cooked a rabbit before?,brienne
Did you ever cook anything for Lord Tyrion?,brienne
What are you doing?,brienne
"I've been removing my own armor for quite some time, thank you very much.",brienne
What exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion?,brienne
"Oh. Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service, did you ever do anything remotely related to combat?",brienne
Who?,brienne
How did you kill a Kingsguard?,brienne
Bloody ridiculous. Help me with these straps.,brienne
How many?,jon snow
Why?,jon snow
Get some rest. We move at sundown.,jon snow

Are you all right? Come with me. Come on.,jon snow
We lost four brothers?,jon snow
I count ten dead mutineers.,jon snow
Where in seven hells? Come here.,jon snow
"I missed you, boy.",jon snow
It's not safe for you here on your own. Mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there's worse out there than Mance. Come with us to Castle Black. We can find you work. Keep you safe.,jon snow
You want to stay here in Craster's Keep?,jon snow
"Your Grace, if you'd like to sit, I'm sure that--",davos
We've been here since midday.,stannis baratheon

"This is Stannis of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.",davos
He shares no blood with me. He is a bastard born of incest. As was his brother before him.,stannis baratheon
It's not a story. It's the truth.,stannis baratheon
Gold you loaned him.,stannis baratheon
More than any man living.,stannis baratheon

None.,stannis baratheon
My lord.,davos
"Well, strictly speaking, I didn't do the thieving. That would be the pirates. I just moved what they stole from one place to another. {DAVOS removes his right glove to show the stubs of his fingers.",davos
"This is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes. I consider it an honest accounting. He's an honest man and he's your best chance to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros. Which is a lot, I imagine. Wars are expensive.",davos
"As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over. Who's the real power in King's Landing?",davos
Humor me.,davos
How old is Tywin Lannister?,davos
"67. And when he dies, who's in command? A half-grown boy, the product of incest? Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her? Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect? When Tywin's gone, who do you back?",stannis baratheon
"Begging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now. There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros. Stannis. He's got the birthright. He's in his prime. He's a tried and tested battle commander. And he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it.",davos
You think they ever met a pirate who didn't tell them that joke?,davos
Only half rotted.,davos

"No, I don't believe her! I know who I am! I'm Reek! Reek! Loyal Reek! Good Reek! I've always been Reek!",theon greyjoy
I'm Reek! Loyal Reek!,theon greyjoy
Reward?,theon greyjoy
I-- I didn't want them to take me. I was so scared. I didn't want them--,theon greyjoy
"Yes, of course, my lord.",theon greyjoy
But how can--,theon greyjoy
Pretend to be who?,theon greyjoy
"You stand before Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons. Don't be afraid, my friend.",daenerys targaryen
I thank him for his prayers.,daenerys targaryen
"Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship. I cannot bring back his goats,",daenerys targaryen
but I will see he is paid their value three times over.,daenerys targaryen
Send the next one in.,daenerys targaryen
The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq can speak to me himself.,daenerys targaryen
I thank you.,daenerys targaryen
Then it is my honor to receive you.,daenerys targaryen
"For that, he has my gratitude. I should be honored to meet him.",daenerys targaryen
Your father crucified innocent children.,daenerys targaryen
"I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime. You'd be wise to remember that.",daenerys targaryen
And what traditions do you speak of?,daenerys targaryen
And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified? They were rotting in the sun as well. Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial?,daenerys targaryen
"Bury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq.",daenerys targaryen
How many more?,daenerys targaryen
212?,daenerys targaryen
The trial begins this afternoon. We only have the morning for affairs of state. Shall we begin?,tywin lannister
"Sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, my lord.",varys
A coward and a traitor.,cersei lannister
"My birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers. I believe the phrase ""fuck the king"" was uttered.",varys
What would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?,tywin lannister
10 silver stags seems a generous bounty.,varys
Make it 100. What else?,tywin lannister
"More whispers from the east, my lord.",varys
The Targaryen girl?,tywin lannister
Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen. She has conquered the city and rules as its queen.,varys
Conquered with what?,cersei lannister
"She commands an army of Unsullied, my queen. Some 8,000 strong. She has a company of sellswords-- the Second Sons. She has two knights advising her-- Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy. And she has three dragons.",varys
"Baby dragons. Larger every year, Your Grace.",cersei lannister
"No longer. He appears to be fully devoted to her. As for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated.",varys
He's an old man. He wasn't fit to protect my son.,cersei lannister
Joffrey didn't die on his watch. Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid.,tywin lannister
Don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world.,cersei lannister
"A child with two seasoned warriors counseling her and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace.",varys
Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years. Armies win them all the time. She must be dealt with.,tywin lannister
"Eventually, if it comes to that. Can your little birds find their way into Meereen?",tywin lannister
"Most certainly, my Lord Hand.",varys
"Mmm. Lord Tyrell, be a good man. Fetch my quill and paper.",tywin lannister
Prince Oberyn.,varys
Only Varys. I'm not actually a nobleman. No one is under obligation to call me lord.,varys
You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied. Did you spend much time in Essos?,varys
May I ask why?,varys
Most of us aren't princes.,varys
I have an ear for accents. I've lost my accent entirely.,varys
It's a long story.,varys
People I trust.,varys
"Not at all. But I was never interested in girls, either.",varys
Nothing.,varys
"Not me. When I see what desire does to people, what it's done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it. Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things.",varys
"Let me guess, I've been pardoned.",tyrion lannister
Really?,tyrion lannister
Father's orders.,jaime lannister
"Well, we mustn't disappoint Father.",tyrion lannister
"Tyrion of the House Lannister, you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide. Did you kill King Joffrey?",tywin lannister
No.,tyrion lannister
"Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?",tywin lannister
Not that I know of.,tyrion lannister
"How would you say he died, then?",tywin lannister
Choked on his pigeon pie.,tyrion lannister
So you would blame the bakers?,tywin lannister
Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.,tyrion lannister
The crown may call its first witness.,tywin lannister
"Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing?",tyrion lannister
Silence.,tywin lannister
Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.,tyrion lannister
"Silence! You will not speak unless called upon. You're dismissed, Ser Meryn.",tywin lannister
By whom?,tywin lannister
"Grand Maester, you examined King Joffrey's corpse. Was it without question poison that killed him?",tywin lannister
Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?,tywin lannister
I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid.,cersei lannister
"Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay. I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines. As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements. He believed his presence would inspire the troops.",cersei lannister
I discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand. I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs. He wasn't pleased.,cersei lannister
"Thank you, Your Grace, for the courage of your testimony.",tywin lannister
"I'm afraid I do, my lord. He said, ""Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies.""",varys
Yes. After we received word of Robb Stark's death. He didn't seem gladdened by the news. Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.,varys
"You're excused, Lord Varys.",tywin lannister
"Father, may I ask the witness one question?",tyrion lannister
One.,tywin lannister
"You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat. You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget. Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?",tyrion lannister
"Sadly, my lord, I never forget a thing.",varys
We will adjourn for now.,tywin lannister
Toll the bells in an hour's time.,tywin lannister
You'd condemn your own son to death?,jaime lannister
I've condemned no one. The trial is not over.,tywin lannister
This isn't a trial. It's a farce. Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.,jaime lannister
I know nothing of the sort.,tywin lannister
You've always hated Tyrion.,jaime lannister
He killed his king.,tywin lannister
As did I. Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me? To bring him your head. I saved your life so you could murder my brother?,jaime lannister
It won't be murder. It'll be justice.,tywin lannister
Justice?,jaime lannister
"I'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King. If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly.",tywin lannister
He'll be executed.,jaime lannister
"No, he'll be punished accordingly.",tywin lannister
"Once you said family is what lives on. All that lives on. You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years. What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line.",jaime lannister
I'm well aware of your oath.,tywin lannister
What happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I don't even remember?,jaime lannister
What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson's killer?,tywin lannister
It survives through me. I'll leave the Kingsguard. I'll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.,jaime lannister
Done.,tywin lannister
"When the testimony's concluded and a guilty verdict rendered, Tyrion will be given the chance to speak. He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch. In three days' time, he'll depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall. You'll remove your white cloak immediately. You will leave King's Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock. You will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister. And you'll never turn your back on your family again.",tywin lannister
You have my word.,jaime lannister
And you have mine.,tywin lannister
"Not going well, is it?",tyrion lannister
You're going to be found guilty.,jaime lannister
"Oh, you think so?",tyrion lannister
"When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall. Father's agreed to it. He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch.",jaime lannister
Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.,tyrion lannister
Father is not Joffrey. He'll keep his word.,jaime lannister
How do you know?,tyrion lannister
Do you trust me?,jaime lannister
Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts. This will all be over soon.,jaime lannister
The crown may call its next witness.,tywin lannister
State your name.,tywin lannister
Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?,tywin lannister
Do you know this man?,tywin lannister
How do you know him?,tywin lannister
This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey. What do you know of this?,tywin lannister
Silence! Continue.,tywin lannister
How did you come to be in his service?,tywin lannister
Silence. Silence!,tywin lannister
Shae. Please don't.,tyrion lannister
"Father, I wish to confess. I wish... to confess.",tyrion lannister
You wish to confess?,tywin lannister
I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all.,tyrion lannister
Tyrion. Do you wish to confess?,tywin lannister
"Yes, Father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?",tyrion lannister
You admit you poisoned the king?,tywin lannister
"No, of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf.",tyrion lannister
You are not on trial for being a dwarf.,tywin lannister
"Oh, yes, I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life.",tyrion lannister
Have you nothing to say in your defense?,tywin lannister
"Nothing but this-- I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had.",tyrion lannister
"Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores.",tyrion lannister
I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.,tyrion lannister
Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn. Escort the prisoner back to his cell.,tywin lannister
I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.,tyrion lannister
I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer.,jaime lannister
"I'm sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?",tyrion lannister
"You threw your life away. You threw it away. It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?",jaime lannister
"Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one. I couldn't- I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies. I couldn't do it.",tyrion lannister
You fell in love with a whore.,jaime lannister
"Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son.",tyrion lannister
Careful. I'm the last friend you've got.,jaime lannister
At least I got to tell them what they really are.,tyrion lannister
"Yes, brilliant speech. They'll be talking about it for days to come. I thought you were a realist. Didn't realize you'd die for pride.",jaime lannister
"Don't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me.",tyrion lannister
I can't save you this time either. My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.,jaime lannister
"Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall.",tyrion lannister
Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.,tyrion lannister
It is tempting.,jaime lannister
"Well... Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again. If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life.",tyrion lannister
If he wins.,jaime lannister
Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.,tyrion lannister
No. Not Ser Meryn.,jaime lannister
Ser Gregor. Welcome to the capital. Thank you for riding here so quickly.,cersei lannister
You seem to be in good form.,cersei lannister
Does it matter?,cersei lannister
Could be soldiers.,arya stark
You shouldn't be sitting out here like this.,arya stark
So why go on?,arya stark
Nothing could be worse than this.,arya stark
Nothing isn't better or worse than anything. Nothing is just nothing.,arya stark
My name is Arya. Arya Stark.,arya stark
You were Yoren's prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall. He told me he'd fuck me bloody with a stick.,arya stark
He can't be. I don't know his name.,arya stark
Thank you.,arya stark
Greetings.,jon snow
"All right, Jon?",sam
"Come on, Ghost.",jon snow
Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.,jon snow
We need to prepare.,jon snow
We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.,jon snow
We wouldn't.,jon snow
"Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have.",jon snow
They won't stop them.,jon snow
The stewards.,jon snow
No.,jon snow
The builders.,jon snow
My lord.,bronn
You have new clothes.,tyrion lannister
Do you like 'em? Eh? Gloves are doeskin. Softer than a virgin's thighs.,bronn
I sent for you days ago.,tyrion lannister
I've been a bit busy.,bronn
Doing what?,tyrion lannister
My lonesome bachelor days are over. I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.,bronn
Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.,tyrion lannister
I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.,bronn
She's dim-witted.,tyrion lannister
"If I wanted wits, I'd marry you.",bronn
"When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?",tyrion lannister
"Falyse. Aye, I did know about the older sister.",bronn
And you understand the rules of inheritance?,tyrion lannister
Falyse is forty and barren.,bronn
She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.,tyrion lannister
She does. Unless she happens to perish before her father. Then Lollys gets the castle.,bronn
What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.,bronn
You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?,tyrion lannister
"You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price.",bronn
Is it two wives you want or two castles?,tyrion lannister
"One of each will do. But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle.",bronn
I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.,tyrion lannister
I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?,bronn
You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.,tyrion lannister
"Your sister's a Lannister, too.",bronn
"My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it.",tyrion lannister
"If and may and could. It's bloody cold up north. Lollys is soft and warm. And close. If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink.",bronn
Does he frighten you so much?,tyrion lannister
"I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?",bronn
Because you're my friend.,tyrion lannister
"Aye, I'm your friend. And when have you ever risked your life for me?",bronn
"I like you, pampered little shit that you are. I just like myself more.",bronn
I understand.,tyrion lannister
I'm sorry it has to be this way.,bronn
Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.,tyrion lannister
We had some good days together.,bronn
"Yes, we did.",tyrion lannister
What will you do?,bronn
I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?,tyrion lannister
I hope to hear them sing it one day.,bronn
"How did you get in here? Your door is well guarded,",daenerys targaryen
Don't do that again.,daenerys targaryen
"These are my private quarters. If I want you here, I will summon you.",daenerys targaryen
Tell me why you're here.,daenerys targaryen
I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing.,daenerys targaryen
"And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue.",daenerys targaryen
You swore me your sword.,daenerys targaryen
So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?,daenerys targaryen
Very well.,daenerys targaryen
Do what you do best.,daenerys targaryen
Take off your clothes.,daenerys targaryen
Khaleesi.,jorah mormont
You're here early.,daenerys targaryen
Later than some.,jorah mormont
You don't approve?,daenerys targaryen
"It's not a question of approval, it's a question of trust.",jorah mormont
You neither approve nor trust.,daenerys targaryen
Why would I? The man's a sellsword.,jorah mormont
Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?,daenerys targaryen
I did.,jorah mormont
I trust you.,daenerys targaryen
Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands. How could you ever have faith in a man like that?,jorah mormont
I could never have faith in a man like Daario. That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.,daenerys targaryen
You have?,jorah mormont
I have.,daenerys targaryen
"Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control.",jorah mormont
"That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai. The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms. They mutilate little boys by the thousands. They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men. They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself.",daenerys targaryen
"Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts. The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known. If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them.",jorah mormont
And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?,daenerys targaryen
"It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought.",jorah mormont
Let the priests argue over good and evil. Slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it. And I will end those behind it.,daenerys targaryen
"I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi.",jorah mormont
And now you are helping me show them to freedom.,daenerys targaryen
I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.,jorah mormont
The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.,daenerys targaryen
Hizdahr zo Loraq?,jorah mormont
He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai. He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen. He will explain the choice they have before them. They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.,daenerys targaryen
"Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves. Tell him I changed my mind.",daenerys targaryen
"Yes, Khaleesi.",jorah mormont
No. Tell him you changed my mind.,daenerys targaryen
"You're doing it wrong. You need to burn away that horrible bit there. Otherwise it's gonna get infected and fester. I know you don't like fire, but if you don't do it right-",arya stark
It'll only take a second. It won't hurt that much.,arya stark
Why?,arya stark
Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.,arya stark
Bit of comfort never hurt anyone. We've been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks. I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you.,brienne
Just don't start expecting silk underclothes. Not working for your former lord any longer.,brienne
Don't get drunk.,brienne
"No, this will do nicely, thank you. Kidney pie is wonderful.",brienne
No.,brienne
We're looking for someone.,brienne
"A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty. Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name.",brienne
I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark. I swore to her I'd bring her daughters home.,brienne
What?,brienne
You wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.,brienne
You're not interesting enough to be offensive.,brienne
What about? Not kidney pie.,brienne
No one's seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded. She's presumed dead.,brienne
When was that?,brienne
So what happened to her?,brienne
The quick version.,brienne
"Um, you were saying?",brienne
"Her mother's dead, grandfather's dead, Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun. The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun.",brienne
Why the Eyrie?,brienne
"Sansa could be there, too.",brienne
You sure about this?,brienne
I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.,tyrion lannister
"Mm, do tell. I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like.",tyrion lannister
Oh.,tyrion lannister
Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.,tyrion lannister
She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time.,tyrion lannister
I think I would have remembered that.,tyrion lannister
You and my family have more in common than you might admit.,tyrion lannister
That would have made things so much easier.,tyrion lannister
"Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants.",tyrion lannister
"If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place.",tyrion lannister
"Hello, Robin.",sansa stark
"I'm building my home, Winterfell. At least I think I am. I haven't been back there in a very long time.",sansa stark
It's a long story.,sansa stark
"Yes, you certainly are.",sansa stark
Probably never. My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.,sansa stark
"No, I'm afraid not. It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground.",sansa stark
We don't.,sansa stark
I never did anything with them at all. Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.,sansa stark
I like the sound of that.,sansa stark
All right.,sansa stark
Careful. You've ruined it. Now I'm going to have to rebuild the whole thing.,sansa stark
You did.,sansa stark
Knocking things down isn't fixing them. It's ruining them.,sansa stark
You're being stupid.,sansa stark
"Robin, I'm sorry, I-",sansa stark
Children.,petyr baelish
I hit him.,sansa stark
"Yes, I saw.",petyr baelish
I shouldn't have done that.,sansa stark
"No, his mother should have a long time ago. Consider it a step in the right direction.",petyr baelish
If he tells Aunt Lysa...,sansa stark
Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.,petyr baelish
I was trying to remember what everything looked like. I'll never see it again.,sansa stark
"A lot can happen between now and never. If you want to build a better home, first you must demolish the old one.",petyr baelish
Why did you really kill Joffrey? Tell me why.,sansa stark
"I loved your mother more than you could ever know. Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love? In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child. But we don't live in that world.",petyr baelish
You're more beautiful than she ever was.,petyr baelish
Lord Baelish...,sansa stark
Call me Petyr.,petyr baelish
"You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?",sansa stark
No.,sansa stark
"I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa. I never should have hit Robin, I know it. I promise it won't happen-",sansa stark
I didn't. You don't understand.,sansa stark
He kissed me. I pulled away.,sansa stark
Please!,sansa stark
Lysa! Let her go.,petyr baelish
Let her go.,petyr baelish
"I'll send her away. I swear on my life. I swear to all the gods. Let her go, Lysa.",petyr baelish
"Oh, my sweet wife. My sweet, silly wife.",petyr baelish
"I have only loved one woman... only one, my entire life. Your sister.",petyr baelish
I should never have left her there.,sam
You couldn't have known.,jon snow
Of course I couldo ve known. They were raiding the villages close by.,sam
She's dead because of me.,sam
"We can't go after them, you know that. That's what they want.",jon snow
Little Same. As if I'd cut their throats myself.,sam
She might have.,sam
"If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next. Mance's army must be close.",jon snow
You think he was spying on you?,daenerys targaryen
The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body. They make love under the stars for the whole Khalasar to see.,daenerys targaryen
But you are not Dothraki.,daenerys targaryen
"Well, I don't see why it matters. Grey worm isn't interested, none of the unsullied care what's under our clothes.",daenerys targaryen
What?,daenerys targaryen
"When the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it?",daenerys targaryen
The...the pillar an the stones.,daenerys targaryen
Haven't you ever wondered?,daenerys targaryen
"I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands.",theon greyjoy
I'm Reek.,theon greyjoy
Always. Forever.,theon greyjoy
Yes.,theon greyjoy
I was born on Pike to Balon Greyjoy. His third and last-living son. I am your prince. I swear it by the drowned god. What is dead may never die.,theon greyjoy
Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell. He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow Ironborn.,theon greyjoy
You are fading from sickness. You are badly outnumbered and you're hundreds of miles from the sea. Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold. Do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me. The Boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore.,theon greyjoy
"My own father, your king, surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon. I watched him bend the knee. There was no shame there. He fought with honor, as did you.",theon greyjoy
"I'm sorry, I didn't hear...",theon greyjoy
scared* You don't know.,theon greyjoy
whispering* Reek. Reek.,theon greyjoy
Reek.,theon greyjoy
Yes. Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates. You're going home.,theon greyjoy
Yes m'lord. Will we go home now?,theon greyjoy
He can stay.,sansa stark
"to Petyr* I'm sorry, Lord Baelish. I have to tell the truth. *to the council* I'll tell you everything.",sansa stark
"My name is not Alayne. It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark. Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell. You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall.",sansa stark
"Lord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing...except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale. He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name.",sansa stark
"You knew her well, my lords, my lady. You knew she was a troubled woman. She always loved Lord Baelish. She told me herself. From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack. She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn. She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have. When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy. For a time. My aunt was a jealous lady. She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore. That he would abandon her for a younger woman. And then...one day she saw him kiss me.",sansa stark
"It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more. Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage. He's always been so kind to me. I was so happy to be here, to be free. All because of him. But my aunt turned on me. She cursed me. Called me a whore. Promised to throw me through the Moon Door. When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him. She said she didn't want to live anymore. She stood on the edge of that Moon Door. He tried to reason with her. Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was...*begins sobbing*",sansa stark
Why did the usurper pardon you?,daenerys targaryen
"No, speak to me here. Explain it to me.",daenerys targaryen
The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged.,daenerys targaryen
"Why, then?",daenerys targaryen
What was the content of these letters?,daenerys targaryen
What information?,daenerys targaryen
You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?,daenerys targaryen
Yes or no?,daenerys targaryen
Don't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?,daenerys targaryen
That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.,daenerys targaryen
Because you knew it was poisoned.,daenerys targaryen
You betrayed me from the first.,daenerys targaryen
You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother's throne...,daenerys targaryen
and you want me to forgive you?,daenerys targaryen
"Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed. But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive. Go back to your masters in King's Landing. Collect your pardon if you can.",daenerys targaryen
"Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name. You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city. If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay. Go. Now.",daenerys targaryen
Yes?,sansa stark
They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.,sansa stark
"If they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me?",sansa stark
Neither do I.,sansa stark
I know what you want.,sansa stark
Lots of things make me happy.,arya stark
"Killing Polliver, killing Rorge.",arya stark
At least I could have been there to watch. I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.,arya stark
You protected him for most of his life. You think you could have saved him?,arya stark
That's your stupid pride talking. It's why you'll never be a great killer. I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.,arya stark
You should have let me burn it.,arya stark
That fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to.,arya stark
You really think my aunt will pay for me?,arya stark
I've never even met her.,arya stark
I'm not a lady.,arya stark
Shall we go?,sansa stark
Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?,tyrion lannister
Soon.,jaime lannister
"Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?",tyrion lannister
I've never seen him fight.,jaime lannister
"Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die.",tyrion lannister
Oberyn believes in himself.,jaime lannister
That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?,tyrion lannister
Beheading.,jaime lannister
"Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word.",tyrion lannister
Cousins.,jaime lannister
"Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?",tyrion lannister
Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.,jaime lannister
Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.,tyrion lannister
Nothing made him happier.,tyrion lannister
Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.,jaime lannister
On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.,tyrion lannister
"The joke wore thin, though.",jaime lannister
For you. You drifted away.,tyrion lannister
I had other interests.,jaime lannister
"Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson.",tyrion lannister
Why?,jaime lannister
"I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. ""Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?"" He gave me an answer. ""Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!"" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library.",tyrion lannister
Volarik. Tried to touch me once.,jaime lannister
"Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of ""khuu, khuu, khuu"". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard ""khuu, khuu, khuu"" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason.",tyrion lannister
"Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?",jaime lannister
"I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once.",tyrion lannister
He was twice your size.,jaime lannister
"He just pushed me aside with a ""khuu"" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?",tyrion lannister
I don't know.,jaime lannister
Good luck today.,jaime lannister
Looks like very light armor.,tyrion lannister
You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight.,tyrion lannister
It could get you killed. It could get me killed.,tyrion lannister
Thank the gods.,tyrion lannister
"standing up* The gods have made their will known. Tyrion Lannister, in the name of King Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, you are hereby sentenced to death.",tywin lannister
What was she like?,sam
She...she had red hair.,jon snow
Oh? How big were her feet?,sam
Well what do you want me to say?,jon snow
I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone. To be with someone. To love someone and have them love you back. We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned. You're the closest I'll ever get to know it.,sam
So you and Gilly never-,jon snow
No...she just had a baby! ...and she never offered.,sam
"But if she had, you wouldo ve? You'd have broken your vows?",jon snow
"The interesting thing is, our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women.",sam
What?,jon snow
"I shall take no wife"" yes, that's in there, there's no denying that. ""I shall father no children"" it's very specific. But what our vows have to say about other...activities...is open to interpretation.",sam
I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.,jon snow
"Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret. We didn't. So what's it like?",sam
"It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet!",jon snow
"No, you're really not.",sam
And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.,jon snow
There'll be arrows for all of us soon I imagine.,sam
There will.,jon snow
They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.,sam
"Go get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch.",jon snow
Maester Aemon. How did you know-,sam
Let me help you.,sam
Maester Faull,sam
But what he says about what they do...it's all true. It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.,sam
I don't love her.,sam
No.,sam
You were?,sam
"I'm sorry Maester, I didn't mean it like that.",sam
Who was she?,sam
Pyp! Open the gate.,sam
Yes!,sam
"Oh, Pyp. Open the fucking gate!",sam
"Yes, well, best get used to it.",sam
"Are you alright? Shh, you're alright. Yeah, of course you are my brave little fella.",sam
I'm so so sorry. I didn't know until I got back.,sam
Never.,sam
"Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me. From now on, wherever you go, I go too.",sam
"There we go, boys. That's one. There's two. Come on, let's get the next lot. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser.",jon snow
Yes sir.,jon snow
"It was a difficult decision either way, Ser.",jon snow
You'll be safe down here. I'll check on you as soon as I can.,sam
I'm not leaving you!,sam
I...I didn't mean in the same room.,sam
Help my brothers.,sam
I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.,sam
"Look. I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly. I made a promise to defend The Wall and I have to keep it, because that's what men do.",sam
I promise you I won't die.,sam
There's a lot more Wildlings on the other side of the wall than this side. We've got us some weapons and things. This is the perfect place for us to be.,sam
"Of course I'm afraid, there's a band of Wildlings coming to kill us.",sam
"I didn't know I was going to kill it, but I had to do something I didn't have any choice, he was going to kill Gilly and take the baby. If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldn't have known. I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore. I wasn't a Steward in the Night's Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that. I was nothing at all. And when you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid.",sam
"Yes, well, I'm not nothing anymore.",sam
Did you get one?,sam
Yeah?,sam
If you keep missing we will.,sam
We can't just let them attack the gate!,jon snow
"Those are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them?",jon snow
Archers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose!,jon snow
They won't summit before dawn.,jon snow
Because I've made that claim.,jon snow
Knock! Draw! Loose!,jon snow
"Oh, is it over?",sam
Well then. *hands Pyp a loaded crossbow*,sam
"You're alright. You're alright. I'll get help. Shh, shh. Maester Aemon is coming, he's gonna make it alright.",sam
Now!,jon snow
"to Grenn* The outer gate won't hold. Take five men, hold the inner gate.",jon snow
grabs Grenn's arm* Hold the gate. If they make it through...,jon snow
Oil!,jon snow
to Grenn* We need more men down here.,sam
But we need men here.,sam
to Olly* Get me to the top! You hear me?!,sam
"Your name's Olly, right? Listen to me Olly, get me to the top and when we give a signal, bring us back down. Do you hear me?",sam
"And find a weapon, Olly. Fight them!",sam
What are you doing up here?,jon snow
The Wildlings are over the walls. Ser Alliser has fallen. The castle walls can't stand much longer.,sam
"Ed. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them.",jon snow
Two brothers now fight with me.,jon snow
to Sam* I don't want you out there.,jon snow
You can't protect me forever. There won't be anywhere to hide if the castle falls.,sam
I need him more than I need you.,jon snow
We need you boy.,sam
"No, shh, don't talk.",jon snow
We'll go back there.,jon snow
"Tormund. It's over, let it end.",jon snow
Put him in chains. We'll question him later.,jon snow
"Aye, you shouldo ve.",jon snow
"Woah! It's me. It's me. I promised you, didn't I?",sam
We held them off.,sam
For one night.,jon snow
This is a great victory.,sam
"Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them.",jon snow
Where are you going?,sam
I'm going to find Mance.,jon snow
To...you can't do that. No one gave you any orders.,sam
"Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home.",jon snow
Without Mance? You're going to kill him?,sam
I'm going to try.,jon snow
"They'll never let you within a hundred yards of him. And if you did, even if you managed to kill him.",sam
He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too.,jon snow
He won't just kill ya. They'll boil you. They'll filet you. They'll make it last days!,sam
You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan?,jon snow
"They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out.",jon snow
What are you doing?,sam
I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back.,jon snow
Jon. Come back.,sam
I've been sent to negotiate with you.,jon snow
"The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows.",jon snow
She put three arrows in me when I escaped.,jon snow
Yes.,jon snow
She's dead.,jon snow
No.,jon snow
Ygritte.,jon snow
That's not wine.,jon snow
He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn.,jon snow
Grenn came from a farm.,jon snow
Grenn and Mag.,jon snow
Turn your army around and go home.,jon snow
I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men.,jon snow
"No, it's like you said, we don't have the men.",jon snow
You're the king beyond the wall?,stannis baratheon
You know who I am?,stannis baratheon
"This is Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of the seven kingdoms.",davos
It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.,stannis baratheon
"I'll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall, I'll have nowhere to put them and nothing to feed them. I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs. Their fate depends on their king.",stannis baratheon
Take these men away.,stannis baratheon
What are men of the Night's Watch doing in a Wildling camp?,davos
I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall.,jon snow
You're speaking to the one true king boy. You'll address him as your grace.,davos
"I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son.",jon snow
Your father was an honorable man.,stannis baratheon
"He was, your grace.",jon snow
What do you think he'd have done with him?,stannis baratheon
"I was this man's prisoner once. He couldo ve tortured me, he couldo ve killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father wouldo ve taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say.",jon snow
Very well. *to Davos* Take him.,stannis baratheon
"Your grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them.",jon snow
Bloody Martells.,cersei lannister
"You're dismissed, Grand Maester.",cersei lannister
Not anymore.,cersei lannister
You can save him?,cersei lannister
Do everything you can. Come to me with anything you need.,cersei lannister
Will it weaken him?,cersei lannister
Very well then.,cersei lannister
"Not another word. We've been over this, the matter's closed.",tywin lannister
I'm opening it again.,cersei lannister
You are betrothed to Loras Tyrell. Still betrothed to Loras Tyrell and you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.,tywin lannister
I will not.,cersei lannister
"Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands. Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow. You have, on several occasions, made great claims about your commitment to this family's future. Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was.",tywin lannister
"I don't care. I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son, the king.",cersei lannister
"When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital. I decided to take your brother with me and not you. You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances and if you recall-",tywin lannister
I'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won. This isn't going to be one of those times.,cersei lannister
Do you think you'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will?,tywin lannister
"When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle at Blackwater, do you remember?! I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen. I was about to give him essence of nightshade, that's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away. Someone awful is coming to take him away.",cersei lannister
No.,tywin lannister
"Joffrey is dead. Myrcella's been sold like livestock. And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy, my last boy. Margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen.",cersei lannister
And how will you do that?,tywin lannister
I'll tell everyone the truth.,cersei lannister
And what truth would that be?,tywin lannister
"You don't know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying, of course it's possible. How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us. One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you wouldo ve known.",cersei lannister
Known what?,tywin lannister
Everything they say is true. About Jaime and me.,cersei lannister
"No, no, no, no, no.",tywin lannister
Your legacy is a lie.,cersei lannister
I don't believe you.,tywin lannister
Yes you do.,cersei lannister
Jaime.,cersei lannister
"You won. One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself. There's really nothing you wouldn't do, is there?",jaime lannister
"For my family, no. I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine.",cersei lannister
Tyrion is your family.,jaime lannister
He's not.,cersei lannister
You don't get to choose.,jaime lannister
"I do, so do you. You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world-",cersei lannister
Are you really mad enough to blame him for that? He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.,jaime lannister
"A disease doesn't decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does. What do you decide? What do you choose?",cersei lannister
"The things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you-",jaime lannister
I choose you.,cersei lannister
Those are words.,jaime lannister
Yes. Like the ones I just said to father. I told him.,cersei lannister
Told him what?,jaime lannister
I told him about us.,cersei lannister
You told him?,jaime lannister
"I told him I wouldn't marry Loras Tyrell. I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you.",cersei lannister
You think he'll just accept that?,jaime lannister
Go and ask him.,cersei lannister
What did you say?,jaime lannister
"I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister. I don't choose Tywin Lannister, I don't love Tywin Lannister. I love my brother. I love my lover. People will whisper, they'll make their jokes. Let them. They're all so small I can't even see them. I only see what matters.",cersei lannister
Someone will walk in.,jaime lannister
I don't care.,cersei lannister
You speak it very well.,daenerys targaryen
I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration. What can I do for you?,daenerys targaryen
I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.,daenerys targaryen
"My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order my friend, this I promise you.",daenerys targaryen
What is it that you want from me?,daenerys targaryen
"You want to return to a man who owned you, like a goat or a chair?",daenerys targaryen
I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy. I took it to bring people freedom. But freedom means making your own choices. I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master. It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.,daenerys targaryen
Approach my friend.,daenerys targaryen
What was her name?,daenerys targaryen
How old was she?,daenerys targaryen
Three. *in Valyrian* And still no word on Drogon?,daenerys targaryen

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.,tyrion lannister
"Tyrion! Put down the crossbow. Who released you? Ah, your brother ,I expect. He always had a soft spot for you. Come, we'll go and talk in my chambers. Is this how you want to speak to me? Shaming your father has always given you pleasure…",tywin lannister
"All my life, you've wanted me dead.",tyrion lannister
"Yes. But you refused to die. I respect that, even admire it. You fight for what's yours. I'd never let them execute you; is that what you fear? I'd never let Illyn Payne take your head. You're a Lannister. You're my son.",tywin lannister
I loved her.,tyrion lannister
Who?,tywin lannister
Shae.,tyrion lannister
"Bah, Tyrion. Put down that crossbow.",tywin lannister
I murdered her. With my own hands.,tyrion lannister

She was a whore!,tywin lannister
Say that word again.,tyrion lannister
And what? You'll kill your own father in the privy? No. You're my son. Enough of this nonsense…,tywin lannister
"I am your son, and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didn't poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. Why?",tyrion lannister
Enough. We'll go back to my chambers and speak with some dignity.,tywin lannister
I can't go back there. She's in there.,tyrion lannister

"It's not silver, it's iron.",arya stark
Valar morghulis.,arya stark
Why not?,cersei lannister
He'll never know we've been gone.,cersei lannister
You don't need to be afraid of my father.,cersei lannister
Yes.,cersei lannister
Of course we should.,cersei lannister
No.,cersei lannister
They said that you were terrifying. With cat's teeth and three eyes. You're not terrifying. You're boring.,cersei lannister
I know you're a witch and you can see the future. Tell me mine.,cersei lannister
This is my father's land. My land. Tell me my future or I'll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head.,cersei lannister
I've been promised to the prince. When will we marry?,cersei lannister
But I will be queen?,cersei lannister
Will the king and I have children?,cersei lannister
That doesn't make sense.,cersei lannister
They will keep waiting. I want a moment alone with him.,cersei lannister
They will wait.,cersei lannister
"He never wanted you to be a King's Guard, but here you are, protecting his dead body.",cersei lannister
"What he built. The towers. He built it for us. He meant it for us. They're going to try to take it away, all of it.",jaime lannister
They?,cersei lannister
All of them out there are enemies. They're waiting a night to make sure he's really dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes they'll set to work on tearing us apart.,jaime lannister
"They had nothing to do with it. The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart, he's the enemy. I've been telling you for years, you've been defending him for years…",cersei lannister
This is exactly what they want.,jaime lannister
and now our father is dead. And that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath. Did you set him free?,cersei lannister
"Tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake. With stupidity. You're a man of action, aren't you? When it occurs to you to do something you do it, nevermind the consequences. Take a look. Look at the consequences. Here they are. He loved you more than anyone in this world.",cersei lannister
Apologies.,varys
I still don't see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail.,tyrion lannister
"I saved your life. If they catch you, they catch me. I cannot say I feel overly guilty about leaving you in that “fucking crate”.",varys
Do you know what it's like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?,tyrion lannister
No. I only know what it's like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.,varys
Pentos?,tyrion lannister
"The home of my colleague. Ilyrio Mopatis. A merchant. He and I met many years ago, through mutual friends. A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was. We tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting the Targaryen restoration. And thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here. Things have gotten worse, not better. Westeros needs to be saved from itself.",varys
Much better.,tyrion lannister
My lord?,varys
I don't think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don't suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time.,tyrion lannister
You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea.,varys
In a box. Why stop now?,tyrion lannister
Because we are talking about the future of our country.,varys
The future is shit. Just like the past.,tyrion lannister
Sons of the Harpy?,daenerys targaryen
They've never killed before.,daenerys targaryen
I didn't conquer them. Their own people did.,daenerys targaryen
"Then they will have to learn to see things differently, Mossador. He did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away. And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos. What was the name of the man you lost?",daenerys targaryen
I want him buried with honor. Publicly. In the Temple of the Graces.,daenerys targaryen
Angry snakes lash out. Makes chopping off their heads that much easier. Find the men who did this and bring them to me.,daenerys targaryen
Get your shield up.,jon snow
"If it wasn't heavy it wouldn't stop a sword, now get it up.",jon snow
Come. Try it again. Drive at me. Keep your shield up. Or I'll ring your head like a bell.,jon snow
"Well, I'm hardly a new recruit. How many brothers can say they've killed a white walker and a Thenn? I might be the first in history!",sam
If Ser Alliser is chosen as the new Lord Commander… he hates the wildlings.,sam
All the wildlings.,sam
"It's not a sure thing. Ser Denys Mallister has commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years, and people say he's a good man. He's running against Ser Alliser--",sam
"I told you. Wherever you go, I go, too.",sam
"Good, good, pivot! Don't forget to pivot! Shield up!",jon snow
"You're not cold, my lady?",jon snow
No.,jon snow
You know who rules at Winterfell now?,stannis baratheon
Roose Bolton.,jon snow
The traitor who plunged a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. Don't you want to avenge him?,stannis baratheon
"I want a great many things, your grace. But I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch now.",jon snow
I've been talking to your sworn brothers. Many of them love you.,davos
They're good men.,jon snow
Many don't. You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall. Why?,davos
It's where she belonged.,jon snow
Some of the Night's Watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings.,davos
They were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesn't make them monsters.,jon snow
No matter. I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it. Tywin Lannister is dead. He can't protect them now. I shall mount Roose Bolton's head on a spike. But if I'm to take Winterfell I'll need more men.,stannis baratheon
The men of the Night's Watch are sworn to play no part--,jon snow
I'm not talking about the damn Night's Watch. I'm talking about the wildlings.,stannis baratheon
"Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army?",jon snow
"If they swear to follow me, I'll pardon them. We'll take Winterfell. Once the North is won, I'll declare them citizens of the realm. I'll give them land to live on.",stannis baratheon
It's a fair offer. More than fair.,davos
I'll offer them their lives and their freedom if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty.,stannis baratheon
I don't think that's likely.,jon snow
"You admire him, don't you?",stannis baratheon
I respect him.,jon snow
He likes you. Convince him to bend the knee...,stannis baratheon
Your grace…,jon snow
or he burns.,stannis baratheon
How much time do I have?,jon snow
"Nightfall. The sun drops fast this time of year. Hurry, Jon Snow.",stannis baratheon
Lord Arryn will never be a great warrior.,petyr baelish
Some boys develop more slowly. He's still young.,petyr baelish
He has other gifts.,petyr baelish
The gift of a great name. Sometimes that's all one needs.,petyr baelish
"Goodbye Lord Royce, and thank you for all you've done for me.",sansa stark
"I have no doubt that upon my return, Robin's skills will have improved immeasurably.",petyr baelish
Us? The only reason you're here is that Jaime Lannister told me you weren't safe in the capital. You're hundreds of miles from King's Landing. No one knows what you look like. No one cares. You're safe.,brienne
Do you even know what a squire is?,brienne
I'm not a knight. That means you're not a squire.,brienne
"I don't care, I'm not your mother.",brienne
I found Arya. She didn't want my protection.,brienne
Will you shut your mouth? I didn't ask for advice. I don't want anyone following me. I'm not a leader. All I ever wanted is to fight for a Lord I believed in. The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.,brienne
You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.,sansa stark
I did.,petyr baelish
But we're heading west.,sansa stark
We are.,petyr baelish
"If he wanted to betray us, he already would have.",sansa stark
"Lord Royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is, but he's not alone in that castle. Do you trust all those knights and ladies, stable boys and serving girls?",petyr baelish
No. Do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us?,sansa stark
"No. But I pay them well, and they've seen what happens to men who disappoint me.",petyr baelish
So where are we going? To a land where you trust everyone?,sansa stark
"So a land so far from here, even Cersei Lannister can't get her hands on you.",petyr baelish
Thank you so much for your kind words.,cersei lannister
Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.,cersei lannister
"Uncle, it's quite alright.",cersei lannister
I'm sure he'll grow out of it. Whatever it is. Excuse me.,cersei lannister
Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed.,cersei lannister
What can I do for you?,cersei lannister
What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?,cersei lannister
I doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere.,cersei lannister
I don't know what you're talking about.,cersei lannister
The day Tywin Lannister's soul needs your help…,cersei lannister
"Eunuch, the spider, the master of whisperers.",tyrion lannister
"Imp, half-man.",varys
There are faster ways to kill yourself.,varys
Not for a coward.,tyrion lannister
"You are many things, my friend, but not a coward.",varys
You never told me why you set me free.,tyrion lannister
Your brother asked me to.,varys
You could have said no.,tyrion lannister
Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.,varys
"Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You're not family, you owe me nothing.",tyrion lannister
I didn't do it for you. I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.,varys
A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.,tyrion lannister
I don't believe in saviors. I believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come.,varys
You're going to have to find another soldier. I'm done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.,tyrion lannister
"You have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them. Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power. But earning it for yourself, that takes work.",varys
I'm not well-suited for work.,tyrion lannister
"I think you are. You have your father's instinct for politics, and you have compassion.",varys
Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.,tyrion lannister
I never said you were perfect.,varys
What is it you want exactly?,tyrion lannister
Peace. Prosperity. A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.,varys
"Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that's how they became powerful in the first place.",tyrion lannister
"Perhaps. And perhaps we've grown so used to horror we assume there's no other way. If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?",varys
I will never sit on the Iron Throne.,tyrion lannister
"No, you won't. But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat. The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis. A monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people. A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name.",varys
Good luck finding him.,tyrion lannister
"Who said anything about him? You have a choice my friend. You can stay here at Ilyrio's palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Mereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for.",varys
Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?,tyrion lannister
Good.,daenerys targaryen
Concessions?,daenerys targaryen
I'm not a politician. I'm a queen.,daenerys targaryen
"I don't expect the Wise Masters to be happy. Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery.",daenerys targaryen
The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death?,daenerys targaryen
No fighting pits.,daenerys targaryen
I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.,daenerys targaryen
How many times must I say no before you understand?,daenerys targaryen
Whatever he wants from me he's not going to get it. If he really believes I'm going to reopen the fighting pits…,daenerys targaryen
What?,daenerys targaryen
Why?,daenerys targaryen
"You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you're defending the fighting pits?",daenerys targaryen
That's why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets.,daenerys targaryen
I don't want another childo s bones dropped at my feet. No one's seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know he's flown halfway across the world. I can't control them anymore.,daenerys targaryen
Viserion? Rhaegal?,daenerys targaryen
Easy. Easy. Easy.,daenerys targaryen
Here we are.,jon snow
This doesn't have to be our last meeting.,jon snow
You know what Stannis wants?,jon snow
Shouldn't a king be bold?,jon snow
You told me you weren't here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough.,jon snow
"You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life's work uniting them. You didn't do it for power. You didn't do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they're north of the wall. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?",jon snow
Then bend the knee and save your people.,jon snow
And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won't go out and rescue them because why? You're afraid of looking afraid.,jon snow
They'll burn you alive.,jon snow
"And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they'll sing songs about you. “You'd rather burn than kneel. The great hero.” Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there's no one left to sing.",jon snow
I think you're making a terrible mistake.,jon snow
"Mance Rayder, you've been called the King Beyond the Wall. Westeros only has one king. Bend the knee, I promise you mercy.",stannis baratheon
Kneel and live.,stannis baratheon
He's just a statue.,arya stark
I'm not afraid.,arya stark
Thank you for bringing me.,arya stark
Valar dohaeris.,arya stark
Hello. Valar Morghulis.,arya stark
Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.,arya stark
Please. I crossed the Narrow Sea. I have nowhere else to go.,arya stark
But wait!,arya stark
"Cersei, Walder Frey, The Mountain, Meryn Trant. Cersei, Walder Frey, The Mountain, Meryn Trant.",arya stark
"The Mountain, Meryn Trant.",arya stark
"Before we left, a maester gave you a raven scroll.",sansa stark
You are becoming an observant young lady.,petyr baelish
"My mother used to say, ""dark wings, dark words"".",sansa stark
An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.,petyr baelish
So it was good news.?,sansa stark
My marriage proposal has been accepted.,petyr baelish
I thought you still mourn the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.,sansa stark
I'll have some.,sansa stark
What is it?,brienne
You sure?,brienne
Littlefinger?,brienne
Bunch? What's a bunch? 100? 6? 20?,brienne
Ready the horses.,brienne
Find more.,brienne
Do you like the taste?,petyr baelish
I don't see what all the fuss is about. Why do men love it so much?,sansa stark
It gives some men courage.,petyr baelish
Does it give you courage?,sansa stark
"Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa, my name is Brienne of Tarth.",brienne
"We've met. With Renly Baratheon. What did he say about you? He said, ""You're a loyalty comes free of charge."" Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then.",petyr baelish
"Lady Sansa, before your mother's death, I was her sworn sword. I gave my word I would find you and protect you. I will shield your back and keep your council, and give my life for yours if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new.",brienne
"Please, Lady Brienne. No need for such formality. You are Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?",petyr baelish
I was.,brienne
Strange. I knew Cat from the time we were children. She never mentioned you.,petyr baelish
It was after Renly's murder.,brienne
"Ah, yes. You were accused of killing him.",petyr baelish
I tried to save him.,brienne
But you were accused.,petyr baelish
By men who didn't see what happened.,brienne
Then what did happen?,petyr baelish
He was murdered by a shadow. A shadow with a face of Stannis Baratheon.,brienne
A shadow? With a face? This woman swore to protect Renly; she failed. She swore to protect your mother; she failed. Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guiding Lady Sansa?,petyr baelish
Why should you have any say in her affairs?,brienne
"Because I am her uncle. I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my belovedo s untimely death. We're family now, and you're an outsider. Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experiences made me wary of outsiders.",petyr baelish
"Lady Sansa, if we can have a word alone--",brienne
No.,sansa stark
"Please, my lady. If I could explain--",brienne
I saw you at Joffrey's wedding bowing to the king.,sansa stark
Neither of us wanted to be there. Sometimes we don't have a choice.,brienne
And sometimes we do. You should leave.,sansa stark
We don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone. The roads of these parts aren't safe. Why don't you stay?,petyr baelish
Podrick!,brienne
"Down, Podrick, down!",brienne
Podrick?,brienne
You can stand now.,brienne
"Wary of strangers, as she should me. I saw her riding on the East Trail with Littlefinger. We'll follow them.",brienne
I swore to their mother I'd protect those girls.,brienne
Do you think she's safe from Littlefinger?,brienne
Get your horse.,brienne
A summons from the queen.,jaime lannister
There are only two like it in the world,cersei lannister
It's a threat.,jaime lannister
"Of course it's a threat! Our daughter's in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family. ""It's a threat.""",cersei lannister
No note.,jaime lannister
"They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister, and every other tragedy that's befallen their cursed country. I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her!",cersei lannister
Softer.,jaime lannister
What?,cersei lannister
Not so loud.,jaime lannister
"Our daughter's in danger, and you're worried I'm speaking too loudly!",cersei lannister
The world can't know knows she's our daughter.,jaime lannister
Then don't call her your daughter. You've never been a father to her.,cersei lannister
"If I was the father to any of my children, they'd be stoned in the streets.",jaime lannister
And what has your caution brought? Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding. Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne. Our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden.,cersei lannister
I'll make things better.,jaime lannister
You never made anything better.,cersei lannister
I'm going to Dorne. I'll bring our daughter home.,jaime lannister
You can't just ask Prince Doran to give her back! She's promised his son.,cersei lannister
I'm not going to ask him anything.,jaime lannister
"You go there with an army, it's an act of war.",cersei lannister
No army. Do you know where they're keeping her?,jaime lannister
Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.,cersei lannister
"I'll find her. Is there anything else, your grace?",jaime lannister
You're going to Dorne? A one-handed man? Alone?,cersei lannister
I never said I was going alone.,jaime lannister
Don't who?,bronn
"They certainly do, my dear. They certainly do.",bronn
"It's a fine place, isn't it? A fine place. I never thought I'd end up settling down in a place like this.",bronn
Pardon?,bronn
Oh.,bronn
You know what I think? I think you're a good person. And your sister is a mean person.,bronn
"I've been all over the world. And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that meanness comes around. People like your sister, they always get what's coming to them eventually. One way or another.",bronn
Jaime fucking Lannister.,bronn
Ser Jaime.,bronn
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.,jaime lannister
I was very sorry to hear about your father.,bronn
Thank you.,jaime lannister
"This is my betrothed, Lollys.",bronn
A pleasure.,jaime lannister
"Run along, love.",bronn
Beautiful bride you've chosen. When were you planning on getting married?,jaime lannister
Just get on with it.,bronn
On with what?,jaime lannister
What you're here for. There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.,bronn
It's very good for you.,jaime lannister
Lollys will be marrying Ser Wyllis Bracken.,bronn
Mmm.,jaime lannister
"We made a deal, your sister and I.",bronn
I would have advised against that.,jaime lannister
How is this good for me?,bronn
"Cause you're going to come with me and help me with something important. And when we return, I'm going to give you a much better girl, and a much better castle.",jaime lannister
Return from where?,bronn
As far south as south goes.,jaime lannister
It would send a message.,daenerys targaryen
Why?,daenerys targaryen
Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.,daenerys targaryen
Thank you all for your counsel.,daenerys targaryen
About what?,daenerys targaryen
The Mad King? You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies? Consider me reminded.,daenerys targaryen
Go on.,daenerys targaryen
I'm not my father.,daenerys targaryen
I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial.,daenerys targaryen
There's a bug.,tyrion lannister
"Yes, best be careful. You might accidentally consume some solid food.",varys
"When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box?",tyrion lannister
You don't like it?,varys
I want to take a walk.,tyrion lannister
You can't. Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head.,varys
"She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere.",tyrion lannister
Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything?,varys
You're right. No point. The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?,tyrion lannister
The road to Meereen.,varys
And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?,tyrion lannister
I told you. A ruler.,varys
We've already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it.,tyrion lannister
"You were quite good, you know. At ruling. During your brief tenure as Hand.",varys
I didn't rule. I was a servant.,tyrion lannister
"Still, a man of talent.",varys
Managed to kill a lot of people.,tyrion lannister
"Yes, but showed great promise in other areas as well.",varys
She wanted me to leave King's Landing. She begged me. I wouldn't go.,tyrion lannister
Why?,varys
Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant.,tyrion lannister
People follow leaders. And they will never follow us. They find us repulsive.,varys
I find us repulsive.,tyrion lannister
"And we find them repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large, comfortable boxes to keep them away. And yet, no matter what we do, people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box. Not for long.",varys
You're right. Let's go for a walk.,tyrion lannister
No.,varys
How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all?,tyrion lannister
Not him.,cersei lannister
"That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn. I don't want to dissuade the other hunters. Mistakes will be made.",cersei lannister
Take the head.,cersei lannister
Very good.,cersei lannister
"No, Uncle. Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself.",cersei lannister
"You're a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I don't imagine you'll have the time. In addition to being Master of Ships, the king has appointed you Master of Coin.",cersei lannister
He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled. He said he would be honored to have you represent the crown's interests in the same.,cersei lannister
The King has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers.,cersei lannister
"The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester. That's far more than the eunuch ever had. Far more than many ever have.",cersei lannister
"Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies, it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War. No man living better deserves the title.",cersei lannister
The king is very busy at this moment.,cersei lannister
"He is learning. On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf.",cersei lannister
My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.,cersei lannister
That is not your concern as Master of War.,cersei lannister
You would abandon your king in his time of need?,cersei lannister
"Hmm! Did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10?",sam
"I only said that the more time you spend practicing, the faster you'll be able to read.",sam
"Three?! Who taught you, your mother?",sam
Did you ever see them?,sam
Your Grace.,sam
"I ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake. You prevented that order from being carried out. You showed mercy to Mance Rayder. A king's word is law. Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers. Show too much kindness, people won't fear you. If people don't fear you, they don't follow you.",stannis baratheon
"With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive.",jon snow
Who then? You?,stannis baratheon
No. Only one of their own.,jon snow
Do you know this wretched girl Lyanna Mormont?,stannis baratheon
The Lord Commander's niece.,jon snow
"Lady of Bear Island, and a child of 10. I asked her to commit her house to my cause, that's her response.",stannis baratheon
"Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark.",jon snow
That amuses you?,stannis baratheon
"I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own.",jon snow
I know. My brother Robert went on often and loudly about how difficult it was to control them - even with your father's help.,stannis baratheon
"Tonight, the Night's Watch elect a new Lord Commander. Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win.",davos
Most likely.,jon snow
Unpleasant man. He thinks you're a traitor. What's your life going to be like on the Wall with Thorne in command?,davos
"Unpleasant, I expect.",jon snow
Your bravery made him look weak. He'll punish you for it. I don't punish men for bravery. I reward them.,stannis baratheon
"I don't doubt it, Your Grace. But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you.",jon snow
You can give me the North.,stannis baratheon
"I can't. Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard. A Snow.",jon snow
"Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet. Pledge me your service and you'll rise again as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell.",stannis baratheon
He'll make you a Stark with the stroke of a pen?,sam
"It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again.",jon snow
You deserve this. You do. I couldn't be happier for you.,sam
I'm going to refuse him.,jon snow
But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.,sam
"I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?",jon snow
Maester Aemon.,sam
Her name is Gilly. Brother Slynt knows her quite well. They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall.,sam
"A wildling girl, a baby, and Lord Janos. I found him there when the battle was over in a puddle of his own making.",sam
"Whilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children, Jon Snow was leading.",sam
"Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true. And when he was wounded, it is Jon who saved us. He took charge of the wall's defense. He killed the Magnar of the Thenns. He went North to deal with Mance Rayder, knowing it almost certainly meant his own death. Before that, he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont. Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward. He saw something in Jon, and now we've all seen it, too. He may be young, but he's the commander we turned to when the night was darkest.",sam
Turn around and go. Turn around and go.,arya stark
Nothing's worth anything to dead men.,arya stark
Who are you? Why were they scared of you?,arya stark
You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.,arya stark

There are no more slaves. There are no more Masters.,daenerys targaryen
"The Harpy's life was not yours to take. Once, the Masters were the law--",daenerys targaryen
The law is the law. Take him.,daenerys targaryen
You opened your gates to me because I promised you freedom and justice. One cannot exist without the other.,daenerys targaryen
A citizen of Meereen was awaiting trial and this man murdered him. The punishment is death.,daenerys targaryen
Leave me.,daenerys targaryen

I've been sweeping this floor for days.,arya stark
I didn't come here to sweep floors.,arya stark
You said that I could be your apprentice. You said you'd teach me how to a Faceless Man.,arya stark
I want to serve. .,arya stark
Which one is the Many-Faced God? I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God. I see the Weirwood Face.,arya stark
Where are they taking him?,arya stark
"You look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She's certainly very pretty, isn't she? Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot. Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell. Not that it matters.",cersei lannister
There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.,cersei lannister
Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?,cersei lannister
This is my real home now. Where my family lives.,cersei lannister
"I know that. I know you do, my sweet boy.",cersei lannister
Don't you look lovely. Marriage agrees with you.,cersei lannister
"No, no. I, I can't stay. I just wanted to let you know if, there is ever anything I can do for you.",cersei lannister
Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.,cersei lannister
Good. Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.,cersei lannister
I'll leave you to it then. .,cersei lannister
There's no need for such formalities.,cersei lannister
Won't that be a lovely day.,cersei lannister
Remember. Anything you need.,cersei lannister
That's Moat Cailin.,sansa stark
"Yes. A bit shabby, isn't it? You've been here before.",petyr baelish
"On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and… where are you taking me?",sansa stark
Home.,petyr baelish
"The Boltons have Winterfell. . The marriage proposal, it wasn't for you?",sansa stark
No.,petyr baelish
Roose Bolton murdered my brother. He betrayed my family!,sansa stark
He did.,petyr baelish
He serves the Lannisters.,sansa stark
For now.,petyr baelish
I won't go.,sansa stark
Winterfell is your home.,petyr baelish
Not anymore.,sansa stark
Always. You're a Stark. Dyeing your hair doesn't change that. You're Sansa Stark. The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark. Your place is in the North.,petyr baelish
I can't marry him. You can't make me. He's a traitor. A murderer.,sansa stark
"You're not marrying Roose Bolton. No, you'll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay. One day he'll be Warden of the North and you will -",petyr baelish
No!,sansa stark
Sansa -,petyr baelish
"No, you can't make me. I will starve myself. I will die before I have to go there.",sansa stark
"I won't force you to do anything. Don't you know by now how much I care for you? Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me. Listen. . You've been running all your life. Terrible things happened to your family and you weep. You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates. You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father. Stop being a bystander, do you hear me? Stop running. There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it. You loved your family. Avenge them.",petyr baelish
We don't. We go around. .,brienne
Doesn't matter. I know where they're going.,brienne
Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp?,brienne
"Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?",brienne
He borrowed it?,brienne
As punishment. For both of you.,brienne
"Yes, all of your lords were very kind to you. All except me. Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person.",brienne
I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.,brienne
"You want to be a knight, Pod?",brienne
"Starting tomorrow, we'll train with the sword twice a day, before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening. . And I'm going to show you how to ride properly.",brienne
"I can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight.",brienne
I was.,brienne
He was.,brienne
"When I was a girl, my father held a ball. I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me. He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. . And it was wonderful. None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance. And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. . My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. I'd never been so happy. . Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. ‘Brienne the Beauty', they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. “Don't let them see your tears,” he told me. “They're nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.” He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. And he was the king's brother after all.",brienne
"Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot. He didn't love me, he didn't want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt. He saved me from being a joke. From that day until his last day. And I couldn't save him in return. Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love. One day, I will avenge King Renly.",brienne
"A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. Stannis is a man, not a shadow. And a man can be killed.",brienne
Lord Commander.,stannis baratheon
Your Grace.,jon snow
I'd like to speak alone.,stannis baratheon
"Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command.",jon snow
Very well. . Have you considered my offer?,stannis baratheon
I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.,jon snow
Say the word and you will be.,stannis baratheon
But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.,jon snow
I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family. To take back the castle where you grew up. To rule the North.,stannis baratheon
"I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch.",jon snow
You're as stubborn as your father. And as honorable.,stannis baratheon
I can imagine no higher praise.,jon snow
"I didn't mean it as praise. Honor got your father killed. . But if your mindo s made up, I won't try to persuade you.",stannis baratheon
"May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?",jon snow
Are you bored of us already?,stannis baratheon
You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.,jon snow
I know it. We march on Winterfell within the fortnight. Before the snows trap us here.,stannis baratheon
And the wildlings?,jon snow
"They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it. I leave their fate to you. You could execute them, that's the safest course. . Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead.",stannis baratheon
"Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. .",jon snow
You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.,stannis baratheon
You have many enemies in Castle Black. Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.,stannis baratheon
I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.,jon snow
Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.,stannis baratheon
"He sees something in you. . Might not be apparent from his tone, but it's the truth. He believes in you.",davos
I'm sorry I disappointed him.,jon snow
The king is a complicated man. But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.,davos
As long as he's ruling them.,jon snow
He's the one true king. He has the blood right to that throne.,davos
I've sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.,jon snow
Have you now? . How does the Night's Watch vow go again? I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.,davos
"Not that bit, the bit at the end.",davos
"Wait, that's enough. “The shield that guards the realm of men.” That's what you swore to be. Now I'm not a learned man, but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world. It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty, and doing what needs to be doing.",davos
And what needs to be done?,jon snow
"As long as the Boltons rule the North, , the North will suffer. Just one man's opinion.",davos
What do you want?,arya stark
What?,arya stark
No one.,arya stark
Ow! Cunt!,arya stark
"I told you, I'm no - . Do that again and -",arya stark
You're about to find out.,arya stark
I am ready.,arya stark
What do we do with them after we wash them?,arya stark
Lord Bolton.,sansa stark
Thank you.,sansa stark
Sam. . Maester Aemon?,jon snow
He apologizes for not being here. He's not feeling well.,sam
"Take good care of him. . Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. . First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. . Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger.",jon snow
"Ser Alliser. . You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger.",jon snow
Lord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard.,jon snow
"Yes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his -",jon snow
"Alright, alright! Enough of that.",sam
"You mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard.",jon snow
Are you refusing to obey my order?,jon snow
Take Lord Janos outside.,jon snow
"Olly, bring me my sword.",jon snow
"If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time.",jon snow
You were assaulted?,cersei lannister
"What do you want from us, High Septon?",cersei lannister
And where do I find this man? This High Sparrow?,cersei lannister
"Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people. . Where can I find the High Sparrow?",cersei lannister
A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?,cersei lannister
Why no shoes?,cersei lannister
Is that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone?,cersei lannister
Perhaps they're right.,cersei lannister
"An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?",cersei lannister
"The High Septon came to speak to me today. He doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you.",cersei lannister
"My thoughts on the matter align with your own. The High Septon's behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude. Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside. So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead. . The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. If one collapses, so does the other. We must do everything necessary to protect one another.",cersei lannister
"Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie, or wherever he's slithering about. .",cersei lannister
How's your work coming along?,cersei lannister
You've made progress?,cersei lannister
"Very good. I'll leave you to it then. Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word ""immediately"".",cersei lannister
I hope so too. I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together. She's suffered enough.,petyr baelish
"I've heard very little about you. Which makes you quite a rare thing, as lords go.",petyr baelish
He seems pleased.,petyr baelish
"I assure you she's still a virgin. Tyrion never consummated the marriage. By the law of the land, she's no man's wife. Inspect her, if you must.",petyr baelish
Then I have delivered everything I've promised.,petyr baelish
"The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did. Tywin is dead. He kept his house in power through sheer will. Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies, Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear.",petyr baelish
"Queen Margaery adores Sansa. Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day.",petyr baelish
"A message for me, you say. Strange that the seal is broken.",petyr baelish
Every ambitious move is a gamble. You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. It appears that your gamble paid off. You're Warden of the North.,petyr baelish
"The Eyrie is mine. The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known. I'd like to borrow one of your birds. Cersei will expect a reply.",petyr baelish
I have to get out of this wheelhouse.,tyrion lannister
Volantis is a large city.,varys
The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold.,varys
"Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse.",tyrion lannister
I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this.,varys
I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.,tyrion lannister
It's a perfectly good face.,varys
I'm losing my mind.,tyrion lannister
"If anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than that.",varys
"Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. . What am I? . One more drunk dwarf.",tyrion lannister
Slaves.,tyrion lannister
Yes. The Volantene masters are very organized. . Flies for dung shovelers. . Hammers for builders. . Tears for whores. Lest they forget.,varys
We should keep moving.,varys
The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr. This one's much better looking.,tyrion lannister
Stone men. Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer. You'd have better luck dancing away the plague. .,tyrion lannister
We're going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me. Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour?,tyrion lannister
Come on. Let's find a brothel.,tyrion lannister
It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.,tyrion lannister
"See? We blend right in. Just two more travellers, mad with lust.",tyrion lannister
Thank you.,varys
Curious... hair. .,tyrion lannister
It appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter.,tyrion lannister
Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously.,varys
"Well, , she's taken.",tyrion lannister
Where're you going?,varys
I need to speak to someone with hair.,tyrion lannister
Hello?,tyrion lannister
You've got no drink.,tyrion lannister
"Do I look like a man without money? . Never trust looks. Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world. . But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? . I always pay my debts, I'm well known for it.",tyrion lannister
That's because they've never met a queen.,tyrion lannister
"You know how to spot a liar. If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you.",tyrion lannister
Because you have a skeptical mind.,tyrion lannister
"I'm, I'm sorry, I can't.",tyrion lannister
I'm not.,tyrion lannister
"Gladly, but this, I can't do. Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am. I hope it passes. What will I do in my spare time? I'll go for a piss, that's a start.",tyrion lannister
"No need to worry, I was just - . Oh, I thought you were someone else. Shows almost over. I'm sure the girls inside will be happy to oblige.",tyrion lannister
You made some kind of mistake. Why don't you tell me what you think you are doing and -,tyrion lannister
I'm taking you to the Queen.,jorah mormont
Is that Estermont?,jaime lannister
Why are we on a merchant ship? Why no Lannister sails?,bronn
"This ship's sailing to Oldtown. We'll get off earlier, not far from Sunspear. Row ourselves to the Dornish shores in the night.",jaime lannister
You ever been to Dorne?,bronn
No.,jaime lannister
I have. The Dornish are crazy. All they want to do is fight and fuck. Fuck and fight.,bronn
You should be happy to go back. .,jaime lannister
"There's nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for fucking. . And there's nothing like a fuck-mad Dornish girl to clear your head for the next fight. It's how the two work together. And we're gonna do a lot of fighting, I am sure. Well, I am. But I don't imagine we'll get to stick around for the rest. Not after we've kidnapped their princess.",bronn
"We are not kidnapping their princess. We are rescuing my niece, bringing her back to the family,",jaime lannister
Your niece?,bronn
I've been doing this sort of thing a long time. I'm good at it. .,bronn
That's why you're here.,jaime lannister
"I know. Why are you here? Why not send 40 of me, or an army? Unlike most folks, you actually got one.",bronn
Because I don't want to start a war.,jaime lannister
That still doesn't explain why you're doing it.,bronn
It has to be me.,jaime lannister
"If I'm putting something of a lit together, a one-handed man, , who happens to be one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros, is not -",bronn
"You set your brother free, didn't you? I bet your sister didn't like that.",bronn
Varys set him free.,jaime lannister
"Well, if you ever see the little fucker, , give him my regards.",bronn
"He murdered my father. If I ever see him, I'll split him in two. And then I'll give him your regards.",jaime lannister
How much can the Crown afford?,cersei lannister
You're the Master of Coin. How do we pay them?,cersei lannister
"You've already given us too much. . No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank.",cersei lannister
In person.,cersei lannister
"We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank, someone of importance, to show these bankers our respect. As the King's Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified.",cersei lannister
The King has expressed concern about his father-in-law's safety on this voyage. . He's ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort.,cersei lannister
"Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.",cersei lannister
Not small enough.,cersei lannister
"May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness?",cersei lannister
The old High Septon would have asked the vintage. .,cersei lannister
Hmm.,cersei lannister
All over Westeros we hear about septs being burned. Silent sisters raped. Bodies of holy men piled in the streets.,cersei lannister
"Perhaps the Gods need a sword of their own. . In the days before the Targaryens, the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven.",cersei lannister
"If I explain the holy purpose to my son, the king, I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy.",cersei lannister
"An army and service to the Gods themselves. And to you, of course. As the chosen representative of the Seven.",cersei lannister
"Which is why you were chosen. . You and I both know how the world works. Too often the wicked are the wealthiest, beyond the reach of justice. The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most.",cersei lannister
What would you say if I told you we have a great sinner in our very midst? Shielded by gold and privilege.,cersei lannister
Did I arrest him?,cersei lannister
"I did. And your wife has every right to criticize. . Can't allow fanatics to arrest the Queen's brother, no matter his perversions.",cersei lannister
"I told you I am not holding Ser Loras. You're the King. I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, he'll release the poor boy.",cersei lannister
Good.,jon snow
Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.,stannis baratheon
"Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way.",stannis baratheon
Not your fault.,stannis baratheon
We must. To beat the snows.,stannis baratheon
I won't. I need you.,stannis baratheon
"And you, my Lady, what do you need?",stannis baratheon
Lord Ashford. . Lady Caulfield. . Lord Smallwood.,sam
Never even heard of these people.,jon snow
They haven't heard of you either. . But we need men and they have some.,sam
And how many men does this Lord Mazin have to send us?,jon snow
More than Lord Wibberley.,sam
Not him.,jon snow
"I know, I'm sorry, but we need men and supplies. And Roose Bolton is the Warden of The North.",sam
He murdered my brother.,jon snow
We swore to be the Watchers on the Wall. We can't watch the Wall with 50 men. And we can't get more men without help from the Warden of the North.,sam
"Apologies, my Lady.",sam
How can I help you?,jon snow
Castle Black is my home now. Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.,jon snow
"You're gonna show me some vision in the fire. Forgive me, my Lady. But I don't trust in visions.",jon snow
I don't think Stannis would like that very much.,jon snow
I can't.,jon snow
I swore a vow. . I loved another.,jon snow
I know. But I still love her.,jon snow
Are you lonely?,stannis baratheon
My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources.,stannis baratheon
"I know Castle Black is no place for a child, but I -",stannis baratheon
Why do you say that?,stannis baratheon
She shouldn't have said that.,stannis baratheon
"When you were an infant, , the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone. His goods were junk except for one wooden doll. He'd even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House. No doubt he'd heard of your birth, and assumed new fathers were easy targets. I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle, , and you pressed it to your cheek. . By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late. . I was told you would die. Or worse, the grayscale would go slow. . Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle. I told them all to go to hell. . I called in every maester on this side of the world. Every healer, every apothecary. They stopped the disease and saved your life. Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men. . You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. And you are my daughter.",stannis baratheon
I thought I might find you here. . Your Aunt Lyanna.,petyr baelish
"Father never talked about her. Sometimes I'd find him down here, lighting the candles. They say she was beautiful.",sansa stark
"I saw her once. I was a boy, living with your mother's family. Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal. Everyone was there. The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon. And Lyanna, she was already promised to Robert. You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists. The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen. When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince. I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair. How handsome he was. Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died. I've never seen so many people so quiet. He rode past his wife, and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. Blue as frost. How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?",petyr baelish
"Yes, he chose her… and then he kidnapped her and raped her.",sansa stark
Come. . Let's speak somewhere the dead can't hear us. .,petyr baelish
Dressed for riding?,sansa stark
I am.,petyr baelish
Where are you going?,sansa stark
King's Landing.,petyr baelish
King's Landing?,sansa stark
Cersei sent for me. . We must not let her sniff out any trouble.,petyr baelish
You can't leave me here!,sansa stark
"I know how hard it is to live with people you despise, believe me. But it won't be for long.",petyr baelish
How do you know?,sansa stark
"Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black. He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way. But first, he has to take Winterfell.",petyr baelish
You don't know that.,sansa stark
"I do. Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons he'll rally your father's bannermen to his cause. With the North behind him, Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne.",petyr baelish
You think he'll defeat the Boltons?,sansa stark
"He has a larger army. He's the finest military commander in Westeros. A betting man would put his money on Stannis. . As it happens, I am a betting man.",petyr baelish
And if you're right?,sansa stark
"Stannis takes Winterfell, he rescues you from the most despised family in the North. Grateful for your late father's courageous support for his claim, he names you Wardeness of the North.",petyr baelish
"But I, I wouldn't… Wardeness of the North",sansa stark
You are the last surviving Stark. He needs you.,petyr baelish
"What if you're wrong? What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell, or he does and the Boltons defeat him?",sansa stark
"Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours.",petyr baelish
I don't know how to do that.,sansa stark
Of course you do. He's already fallen for you.,petyr baelish
His father frightens me.,sansa stark
"He should, he's a dangerous man. But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered. And you've learnt to maneuver from the very best. . I return before too long. . You'll be strong without me. . The North will be yours. Do you believe me?",petyr baelish
I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return.,sansa stark
Breakfast.,bronn
That would have been a shit way to die.,bronn
"As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die.",jaime lannister
Aye. But your lot like to give the singers a good ending.,bronn
I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.,jaime lannister
"No? Two knights, off to rescue a princess. Sounds like a good song to me.",bronn
Sounds like all the rest.,jaime lannister
What about you? What shit way would you choose?,jaime lannister
"In my own keep, drinking my own wine, watching my sons grovel for my fortune.",bronn
How disappointing. I thought you'd have something more exciting planned.,jaime lannister
I've had an exciting life. I want my death to be boring. How do you want to go?,bronn
In the arms of the woman I love.,jaime lannister
She want the same thing?,bronn
Let's go.,jaime lannister
"The captain to that ship… What was he, Braavosi?",bronn
Pentoshi.,jaime lannister
And he's headed to Oldtown?,bronn
As I said. Why?,jaime lannister
What's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister's in Dorne?,bronn
A bag of gold.,jaime lannister
I'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world.,bronn
It was a heavy bag.,jaime lannister
And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it. But you won't be around if he breaks them.,bronn
How many you count?,bronn
Four.,jaime lannister
How many you think you can take?,bronn
"One, if he's slow.",jaime lannister
"Fucked in the arse. . Hiya! . Morning, lads. Glad we found you.",bronn
Cooper. . This is Darnell.,bronn
Accent gave me away? Flea Bottom. Whelped and whipped.,bronn
"Our ship capsized in the night. We managed to swim ashore. It was a near thing, really.",bronn
I thought the sharks would get us. .,jaime lannister
I could have sworn those were shark fins.,jaime lannister
Dolphins maybe.,bronn
"Boys, there's no need for this. Just, point us in the right direction. We'll find our way home.",bronn
That one should be slow enough.,bronn
Nice move! .,bronn
Luck.,jaime lannister
You had a wonderful teacher.,bronn
Always wanted a Dornish stallion. Beasts can run a day and night without tiring. We'll ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face.,bronn
First we need to bury these bodies.,jaime lannister
Birds have to eat too.,bronn
"Corpses raise questions, questions raise armies. We're not here to start a war.",jaime lannister
Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes?,bronn
"I can't dig very well with one hand. Not at all, really.",jaime lannister
Thank you. . Who are you?,tyrion lannister
Your captor.,jorah mormont
Do you have wine?,tyrion lannister
No.,jorah mormont
I can't sleep without wine.,tyrion lannister
Then stay awake.,jorah mormont
You're going the wrong way. My sister's in Westeros. Westeros is west! We're heading east.,tyrion lannister
I'm not taking you to your sister.,jorah mormont
You said you were taking me to the Queen.,tyrion lannister
I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen. She's the Queen I serve.,jorah mormont
What a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself!,tyrion lannister
What business would you have with the Queen?,jorah mormont
"Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand. So now that it's clear we're on the same side? . A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. . And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely.",tyrion lannister
Everyone looks happy enough from up here. . What?,daenerys targaryen
Why?,daenerys targaryen
He sang to them?,daenerys targaryen
And what did you do?,daenerys targaryen
He was good?,daenerys targaryen
He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. .,daenerys targaryen
And what did you do with the money?,daenerys targaryen
How many others are there?,daenerys targaryen
"Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan?",daenerys targaryen
"I think I can protect me from Hizdahr Zo Loraq. Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me.",daenerys targaryen
Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?,daenerys targaryen
I do not recognize this tradition.,daenerys targaryen
"Barristan the Bold"" they called him. He crossed a continent to serve me. He was a loyal friend. And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks.",daenerys targaryen
I prefer your earlier suggestion. Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me.,daenerys targaryen
Walk forward.,daenerys targaryen
Another step.,daenerys targaryen
"They will eat you, if I tell them to. They may eat you even if I don't. Children. Some say I should give up on them. . But a good mother never gives up on her children. She disciplines them if she must.",daenerys targaryen
But she does not give up on them.,daenerys targaryen
"Who is innocent? Maybe all of you are, , maybe none of you are. Maybe, , I should let the dragons decide.",daenerys targaryen
Don't want to overfeed them. Tomorrow perhaps.,daenerys targaryen
"And though Daenerys maintains her grip on Slaver's Bay, forces rise against her from within and without. She refuses to leave until the freedom of the former slaves is secure."" She sounds like quite a woman.",sam
"Don't say that, Maester Aemon.",sam
Maester Aemon.,jon snow
"Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone.",jon snow
How are you feeling?,jon snow
"I need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order.",jon snow
But you don't know what it is.,jon snow
Where are the rest of the free folk now? . Where have they gone? . Who leads them?,jon snow
What about you?,jon snow
What if I unchained you?,jon snow
Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.,jon snow
"For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you.",jon snow
It is.,jon snow
"Because now, , I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.",jon snow
I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.,jon snow
I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.,jon snow
"And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward.",jon snow
Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people.,jon snow
Up on Storroldo s Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week.,jon snow
I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.,jon snow
"Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing.",jon snow
Fewer.,stannis baratheon
What?,davos
Nothing.,stannis baratheon
There is good farmland in the Gift. . Land that no one uses now. A dozen abandoned villages.,sam
And we've slaughtered theirs.,jon snow
"You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that.",jon snow
"Thank you. . Olly. . If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right.",jon snow
It's not a trick.,jon snow
I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone.,jon snow
No.,jon snow
Better off with the Boltons who murdered her mother and brother? Sansa's in danger even if she doesn't realize it.,brienne
Thank you. You've lived here a long time?,brienne
Did you know Lord Eddard?,brienne
Not all of them. I know who's inside that castle.,brienne
I'm not talking about the Boltons. I need to get a message to her. To Sansa Stark.,brienne
Someone who swore to keep her safe.,brienne
Her mother.,brienne
That doesn't release me from an oath. I served Lady Catelyn. I serve her still. Who do you serve?,brienne
"Oh, I don't need-",sansa stark
But who -,sansa stark
I made it myself.,sansa stark
"Who, who are you?",sansa stark
My mother. .,sansa stark
Thank you.,sansa stark
I'd rather have a mother.,sansa stark
What is it?,sansa stark
Theon?,sansa stark
You shouldn't be here.,theon greyjoy
"No, my lord.",theon greyjoy
She saw me.,theon greyjoy
Sansa. Lady Sansa. She came to the kennels.,theon greyjoy
"Yes. I'm sorry, master. Forgive me. I didn't think -",theon greyjoy
"Yes, thank you, my lord.",sansa stark
This isn't a strange place. This is my home. It's the people who are strange.,sansa stark
"Yes, master.",theon greyjoy
Why are you doing this?,sansa stark
I'm sorry.,theon greyjoy
For killing your brothers.,theon greyjoy
I'm very happy for you.,sansa stark
Every book there is?,sam
"Well, no. There are thousands and thousands of books out there. This library is rather small, actually.",sam
My father's not the most literate man. They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.,sam
The Citadel? In Oldtown.,sam
"Gilly, look at me. You know how to do a hundred things I can never do. You can build a fire with wet wood. You can cook. You can stitch a wound.",sam
Well -,sam
It's where they train the maesters.,sam
"I wanted to be one when I was young. Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch. Far more adventure up here anyway. I wouldn't have met you.",sam
"Ah, Your Grace.",sam
You're Samwell Tarly?,stannis baratheon
"I am, Your Grace.",sam
"Your father is Randyll Tarly. He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford. Only battle Robert ever lost. I told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon, but he never listened. Fine soldier, your father. You don't look like a soldier. But I'm told you killed a white walker.",stannis baratheon
"I did, Your Grace.",sam
How?,stannis baratheon
With a dagger made of dragonglass.,sam
Dragonglass?,stannis baratheon
What the maesters call obsidian -,sam
I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone. Why would obsidian kill a walker?,stannis baratheon
"I don't know. I've been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something, and all I've learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass.",sam
The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall.,stannis baratheon
"I've seen it, Your Grace.",sam
Seen what?,stannis baratheon
The army of the dead. And when they come -,sam
"We have to know how to fight them. . Keep reading, Samwell Tarly.",stannis baratheon
It's time.,stannis baratheon
"Uh, Your Grace. Wouldn't it be better to wait? When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men.",davos
"If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings. We can't wait that long. We have the advantage, more men, more horses, all fed and rested. But every day we wait, the odds shift in Bolton's favor. This could turn to winter at any moment. We have to act now. Give the order. We march at sunrise.",stannis baratheon
I'll choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess.,davos
"No need, they're coming with us.",stannis baratheon
"It's a tough road ahead, Your Grace. Won't they be safer -",davos
"Here? Half these watchmen are killers and rapists. No, they march with us.",stannis baratheon
"As you wish, Your Grace.",davos
Beg your pardon?,davos
First things first. It's a long march ahead. And then we have to take the castle.,davos
"Aye, princess, but you won't be anywhere near -",davos
"Yes, my queen.",davos
"Well, I am. When the battle comes, promise you'll protect me.",davos
I hope you know what you're doing with these wildlings. I need those ships.,stannis baratheon
"You'll get them back, I swear it. Have a safe journey, Your Grace. And thank you.",jon snow
"If I give everyone what they deserve, I'll have no one left to rule. Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died. Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself. What do you think?",daenerys targaryen
You are as fit as anyone I know. You know why I'm here. And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart. So what do you think?,daenerys targaryen
"What about ""Valar Morghulis""?",daenerys targaryen
"It takes courage to admit fear. And to admit a mistake. I came here to tell you that I was wrong. I was wrong and you were right. About tradition. About bringing the people of this city together. I will reopen the fighting pits. To free men only. Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live.",daenerys targaryen
"And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family. . Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees.",daenerys targaryen
"Don't worry. I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think. Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne. . Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let's start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip. We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen.",tyrion lannister
We are.,jorah mormont
What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine.,tyrion lannister
No wine.,jorah mormont
"I am a person who drinks. People who drink need to keep drinking. Otherwise, they're not…",tyrion lannister
I know where we are. You're taking us through Valyria.,tyrion lannister
I am.,jorah mormont
Have you sailed this route before?,tyrion lannister
No.,jorah mormont
You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough?,tyrion lannister
I think you'll be plenty.,jorah mormont
You know what they say. The Doom still rules Valyria. What about the demons and the flames? Aren't you afraid of the Doom?,tyrion lannister
No. But the pirates are.,jorah mormont
Oh.,tyrion lannister
The Smoking Sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then -,tyrion lannister
And then they weren't.,jorah mormont
"And then they weren't. ""They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned -""",tyrion lannister
"The city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned; The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned.",jorah mormont
I would clap.,tyrion lannister
"I suppose this is it, then. This is what remains.",tyrion lannister
What was that?,tyrion lannister
Stone Men! Don't let them touch you!,jorah mormont
Get behind!,jorah mormont
"Mormont, cut me free! . Mormont!",tyrion lannister
Mormont! Mormont!,tyrion lannister
Tyrion? Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion. You're all right.,jorah mormont
You're heavier than you look. Did any of them touch you?,jorah mormont
"You? . I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that.",tyrion lannister
I suppose that's why they send them there.,jorah mormont
"It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. . Thank you for saving me. Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place. . So what now?",tyrion lannister
"We walk, up the coast. With luck, we'll find a fishing village. Maybe another boat.",jorah mormont
Without luck?,tyrion lannister
"We've got a long walk ahead of us. I'll get some wood for a fire. Try to get some rest, huh?",jorah mormont
That's the best idea you've had all day.,tyrion lannister
What are they doing with the bodies?,arya stark
No! I've been here for weeks. I'm not scrubbing one more corpse until you tell me why I'm doing it.,arya stark
When?,arya stark
When do I get to play the game?,arya stark
The game. The game of faces.,arya stark
I didn't even know I was playing.,arya stark
No one.,arya stark
Well who are you? What are you doing here? How'd you get here?,arya stark
What?,arya stark
Arya.,arya stark
Westeros. My family home is Winterfell. I'm the youngest daughter of a great lord. Eddard Stark. He died in battle.,arya stark
After he was executed I fled the capital. Had to kill a stable boy. Drove my sword through his back.,arya stark
I stabbed him in the gut. I tried to find my mother and brother. I never did. They were murdered by Walder Frey. An outlaw kidnapped me. A man called Polliver.,arya stark
"A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane. He tried to sell me but was wounded in a fight. He begged me to kill him but I wouldn't. I left him in the mountains to die. I wanted him to suffer, I hated him.",arya stark
I hated him.,arya stark
I hated him!,arya stark
That's not a lie!,arya stark
Yes.,arya stark
I'm not playing this stupid game anymore!,arya stark
"So, those villages we were supposed to find. We can't live on berries and roots.",tyrion lannister
I can.,jorah mormont
You're not hungry?,tyrion lannister
Of course I'm hungry.,jorah mormont
"You're an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met.",tyrion lannister
I am not your travelling companion.,jorah mormont
We are travelling together. In each other's company. Therefore…,tyrion lannister
Do you ever shut up?,jorah mormont
I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word.,tyrion lannister
Why?,jorah mormont
Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.,tyrion lannister
I'm sure you've visited many brothels in many cities.,jorah mormont
I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn't commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved.,tyrion lannister
"As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man.",tyrion lannister
What do you know about my father?,jorah mormont
"I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? “We shall never see his like again.”",tyrion lannister
You didn't know. I'm sorry. I am.,tyrion lannister
How?,jorah mormont
I only know what I heard,tyrion lannister
He was leading an expedition beyond the wall. There was a mutiny. He was murdered by his own men.,tyrion lannister
We better keep moving.,jorah mormont
Valar dohaeris.,arya stark
"I know. Don't be afraid. I used to be like you. I was sick. I was dying. But my father never gave up on me. He loved me. More than anything in the world, just like your father loves you. So he brought me here. My father prayed to the many faced god. And I drank the water from this fountain. It healed me.",arya stark
I've devoted my life to him now. You don't want to hurt anymore. Drink.,arya stark
"Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert's Rebellion.",tyrion lannister
Do you believe in anything?,jorah mormont
I believe in many things.,tyrion lannister
"In something greater than ourselves, I mean. The Gods. Destiny. Do you believe there's a plan for this world?",jorah mormont
No.,tyrion lannister
"Neither did I. I was a cynic, just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought I'd find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?",jorah mormont
It's hard to be a cynic after that.,jorah mormont
Doesn't mean she's going to be a great queen.,tyrion lannister
No it doesn't.,jorah mormont
"The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?",tyrion lannister
First we have to conquer the world.,jorah mormont
"We? Alright, let's assume your dreams come true. She's ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?",tyrion lannister
Then she rules.,jorah mormont
So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That's justice?,tyrion lannister
She is the rightful heir.,jorah mormont
"Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?",tyrion lannister
Shh! It's a slave ship,jorah mormont
Why is it anchored?,tyrion lannister
They probably came ashore for--,jorah mormont
"Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let's discuss this!",tyrion lannister
"Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can't just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?",tyrion lannister
Guess again.,tyrion lannister
Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.,jorah mormont
"The fighting puts in Mereen! You're in luck then, you're about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms.",tyrion lannister
Him.,tyrion lannister
"Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!",tyrion lannister
"He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.",tyrion lannister
The Kingslayer!,tyrion lannister
I killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat.,jorah mormont
"It's no lie. His name was Qotho. He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo. Take me to Slaver's Bay, put a sword in my hand, I'll prove my worth.",jorah mormont
Yes? Lancel Lannister.,petyr baelish
That's quite a family to abandon.,petyr baelish
Well done.,petyr baelish
I'm here on urgent business for the Queen Mother. Should I send word that I'll be delayed?,petyr baelish
"We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel. Mine just happen to be entertaining.",petyr baelish
"Do you think it's wise, your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden?",petyr baelish
The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.,cersei lannister
Of course. And the Faith were armed on your orders.,petyr baelish
The King's orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras' perversion?,cersei lannister
House Tyrell won't tolerate these insults.,petyr baelish
"House Tyrell won't tolerate it? I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys.",cersei lannister
One's choice of companion is a curious thing.,petyr baelish
Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you're still in mourning.,cersei lannister
Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.,petyr baelish
"She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him.",cersei lannister
I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age.,petyr baelish
If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?,cersei lannister
Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.,petyr baelish
Good. If there's nothing else.,cersei lannister
"There is another matter, your Grace. Something so urgent I couldn't trust the words to a raven. You once charged me with finding Arya Stark. To my shame I failed you. But I have found Sansa Stark. Alive, and well, and home again. In Winterfell.",petyr baelish
That's not possible.,cersei lannister
"My sources are well placed. They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen.",petyr baelish
Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.,cersei lannister
Indeed. As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.,petyr baelish
We were fools to trust a turncloak.,cersei lannister
Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.,petyr baelish
I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil.,cersei lannister
"I would counsel patience, your grace.",petyr baelish
"Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor.",cersei lannister
"Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they're done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives.",petyr baelish
"Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn.",cersei lannister
"That is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds. Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force.",petyr baelish
My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.,cersei lannister
"Ser Jaime, then.",petyr baelish
Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. I've no idea when he'll be back.,cersei lannister
"Perhaps I can help. The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow.",petyr baelish
"Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man.",cersei lannister
"You wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury. What do you have to lose, a brothel keeper?",petyr baelish
And if you succeed?,cersei lannister
Name me Warden of the North.,petyr baelish
I'll speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree.,cersei lannister
I'll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.,petyr baelish
And I'll l know you're a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike.,cersei lannister
As I said. I live to serve.,petyr baelish
The Dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring. The Dornishman's blade it was made of black steel and its kiss was a terrible thing. The Dornishman's wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach...,bronn
"Alright, thats enough.",jaime lannister
I'm coming to the best part.,bronn
We're trying to blend in. We don't want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent.,jaime lannister
This song really is all about the ending.,bronn
It can wait. Up there.,jaime lannister
That's the Water Gardens.,jaime lannister
"Once we got the princess, then what?",bronn
I like to improvise.,jaime lannister
That explains the golden hand.,bronn
"Well, she's made herself at home.",bronn
Myrcella.,jaime lannister
Let's speak in private.,jaime lannister
Excellent. Good to meet you.,jaime lannister
"Why don't you let them have some time alone, son?",bronn
Let's not do something stupid.,bronn
That was something stupid.,bronn
"We have to go, Myrcella, now.",jaime lannister
"You'll be fine, I promise, but we have to--",jaime lannister
Oh for fuck's sake.,bronn
You fight pretty good for a little girl.,bronn
"Oh! You can smell the shit from 5 miles away. Well, why are we stopped, go on.",olenna tyrell
"Rumors and gossip, that's all they got. It's theater, nothing more. If they arrested all the pillow biters in King's Landing there'd be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else.",olenna tyrell
Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone knew. No one cared.,olenna tyrell
"And Loras is the queen's brother. No, no, no, no, this is unacceptable.",olenna tyrell
"Of course she is. She wants to drag our names through the dirt. Put us in our place. Get some rest, dear, you look appalling. Let me deal with Cersei Lannister.",olenna tyrell
"Your Grace, I have travelled a long way.",olenna tyrell
You must be exhausted.,cersei lannister
"Put the pen down, dear, we all know you aren't writing anything.",olenna tyrell
"Ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns.",cersei lannister
And the famous tart Queen Cersei.,olenna tyrell
Beg your pardon.,cersei lannister
I know you're behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.,olenna tyrell
If you apologize for that comment perhaps--,cersei lannister
You'll get your apology when I get Loras.,olenna tyrell
I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?,cersei lannister
"Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?",olenna tyrell
I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains--,cersei lannister
Do you expect the alliance to continue after you've thrown our future into prison?,olenna tyrell
"As I said, i didn't imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats--",cersei lannister
What veil?,olenna tyrell
The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?,cersei lannister
I didn't trust your father. I didn't particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.,olenna tyrell
"House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I'm sure they don't. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we'll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna.",cersei lannister
Well I think that's quite enough of that.,olenna tyrell
This testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?,cersei lannister
What are you doing? Let us pass.,olenna tyrell
What do you want?,sansa stark
What others?,sansa stark
Hunt?,sansa stark
What was your name again?,sansa stark
"And how long have you loved him, Myranda. Did you imagine that he would be with you forever, is that it? Then I came along and ruined it. I am Sansa Stark of Winterfell. This is my home and you can't frighten me.",sansa stark
Go. I can finish on my own.,sansa stark
Yes?,sansa stark
"I've come to escort you to the Godswood, my lady. If you please, my lady, will you take my arm?",theon greyjoy
No.,sansa stark
"Lord Ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm.",theon greyjoy
I'm not touching you.,sansa stark
Please. He'll punish me.,theon greyjoy
Do you think I care what he does to you.,sansa stark
"Sansa of the House Stark comes here to be wed. A woman grown, trueborn and noble. She comes to beg the blessings of the gods. Who comes to claim her?",theon greyjoy
Theon of House Greyjoy. Who was… who was her father's ward.,theon greyjoy
I take this man.,sansa stark
Yes.,sansa stark

"Safe travels, Lord Commander.",sam
"Thank you, Sam.",jon snow
"Oh, and…",sam
It's Dragonglass. It's what I used to kill the White Walker. I hope you don't need them.,sam
Me too.,jon snow
"His little brother, Aegon. He became king.",sam
"Theon, wait.",sansa stark
"Not Theon, my lady. Reek.",theon greyjoy
Help me.,sansa stark
You're his wife now.,theon greyjoy
Theon,sansa stark
Do what he says. Do what he says or he'll hurt you.,theon greyjoy
He already hurts me every night. All day I'm locked in this room and every night he comes. It can't be worse.,sansa stark
It can. It can always be worse.,theon greyjoy
What did he do to you?,sansa stark
Please…,theon greyjoy
You betrayed my family!,sansa stark
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!,theon greyjoy
You have to help me!,sansa stark
He'll see us. You don't know him.,theon greyjoy
"My family still has friends in the North. All I have to do is give a signal and they'll rescue me. Climb to the top of the Broken Tower, light this candle, and put it in the window. Promise me, Theon.",sansa stark
"Reek, my lady, Reek!",theon greyjoy
"Your name is Theon Greyjoy. Last surviving son of Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands, do you hear me? Theon. Promise me.",sansa stark
You don't know that.,sam
I'll stay too. He's always been good to me. I can't leave him now.,sam
"His name was Aemon Targaryen. He came to us from King's Landing, a Maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn. And a sworn brother of the Night's Watch, ever faithful. No man was wiser or gentler or kinder. At the Wall a dozen Lord Commanders came and went during his years of service, but he was always there to counsel them. He was the blood of the dragon, but now his fire has gone out. And now his watch has ended.",sam
But isn't your step mother pregnant?,sansa stark
What happens if she has a boy?,sansa stark
But he'll be the heir.,sansa stark
"But you're a bastard, a true born will always have the stronger claim.",sansa stark
Tommen Baratheon. Another bastard.,sansa stark
40 horses died in the night. We'll lose more come sunset. We're running out of food. We can't open the supply line until the snow clears.,davos
What else?,stannis baratheon

500 men.,stannis baratheon
"Sell swords, loyal to nothing but gold.",stannis baratheon

And?,stannis baratheon
"This isn't our time, we should head back to Castle Black when the snow clears.",davos
"I retreated from King's Landing, Ser Davos. If I retreat again, I become “The King Who Ran.”",stannis baratheon
Your Grace..,davos
"Winter is coming. Those arent just the Stark words, it's a fact. If we march back to Castle Black, we winter at Castle Black. And who can say how many years this winter will last.",stannis baratheon
It's better to wait for the right time than to risk everything.,davos
"This is the right time, and I will risk everything. Because if I don't, we've lost. We march to victory or we march to defeat, but we go forward only forward,",stannis baratheon
Your Grace.,davos
"I've trusted in your visions, in your prophecies for years.",stannis baratheon
I don't know what I saw.,stannis baratheon
"And you, do you trust yourself?",stannis baratheon
Are you sure?,stannis baratheon
We don't have Robert's bastard here.,stannis baratheon
Have you lost your mind?,stannis baratheon
There must be another way. Leeches or something.,stannis baratheon
She's my daughter.,stannis baratheon
Get out.,stannis baratheon
Get your hands off her. Brother Derryk. Brother Brand. I believe you both have guard duty tonight.,sam
"Gilly go on, Get back to your room and lock the door.",sam
I'm warning you.,sam
I said get your hands off her.,sam
I killed a White Walker. I killed a Thenn. I'll take my chances with you.,sam
I'm alright.,sam
I will not. They wouldo ve… I don't know what they would have done,sam
No. They were tiring out. I had them in the palm of my hand.,sam
What kind of man would I be if I ran away when I saw someone hurting you?,sam
"Of course I will. And I'll take care of you, too.",sam
Stay. Please.,sam
Oh. Oh my.,sam
Wait! You have to buy me as well.,tyrion lannister
"We're a team. I'm a great fighter, too.",tyrion lannister
Thank you my Lord. Thank you.,tyrion lannister
"My Lord, if I may. I've heard Mereen's become a free city. You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits. Now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage…",tyrion lannister
Don't be ridiculous. My marriage to Hizdahr is political. I think he's smart enough to understand that.,daenerys targaryen
Are you jealous?,daenerys targaryen
I do.,daenerys targaryen
"You told me yourself, I can't fight enemies within and without. So when enemies from without come knocking, I need the city of Mereen behind me. I have no choice.",daenerys targaryen
So what else can I do?,daenerys targaryen
"Even if I wanted to do such an inadviseable thing, I couldn't.",daenerys targaryen
No. I can't,daenerys targaryen
Of course,daenerys targaryen
I am a queen. Not a butcher.,daenerys targaryen
"You there! Where would I find the High Septon, or High Sparrow, or whatever bloody fool name he's got.",olenna tyrell
You should have the decency to stand when you talk to a lady.,olenna tyrell
Don't spar with me little fellow.,olenna tyrell
Hips.,olenna tyrell

"Spare me the homilies, I can smell a fraud from a mile away.",olenna tyrell
I'm here for my grandson and granddaughter.,olenna tyrell
Don't you walk away from me.,olenna tyrell
What is it you want? Gold? I'll make you the richest septon who ever lived.,olenna tyrell
What then?,olenna tyrell
How do they communicate their demands? By raven or horse?,olenna tyrell
I've read the seven pointed star.,olenna tyrell
"Half the men, women, and children in this foul city break the sacred laws. You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists. And yet you punish Loras for shagging and Margaery for defending her brother?",olenna tyrell
"If it's equality you want then so be it. When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital, everyone here will starve. And I'll make sure the hungry know who to blame,",olenna tyrell
"Starving yourself won't make things any better for her, my love.",cersei lannister
"No matter who you are, no matter how strong you are, sooner or later, you'll face circumstances beyond your control.",cersei lannister
You know as well as I do who the first casualty in that war would be.,cersei lannister
We must be strong for those we love. We cannot give in to despair.,cersei lannister
Let me speak to him on your behalf. The king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.,cersei lannister
Your happiness is all I want in this world,cersei lannister
"No you don't. You can't possibly. Not until you have children of your own. I would do anything for you. Anything to keep you from harm. I would burn cities to the ground. That is all that matters. You and your sister. From the moment you came into this world, my boy. My only boy.",cersei lannister
And more hands. How's Trystane?,jaime lannister
I'm sorry for that. It wasn't supposed to happen that way.,jaime lannister
Your mother's worried about you. Threats have been made. Dorne is too dangerous for you. I've come to take you home.,jaime lannister
It's for your own good. These are complicated matters.,jaime lannister
I don't understand.,jaime lannister
"Brothers oh brothers, my days here are done, the Dornishman's taken my life. Bur what does it matter, for all men must die, and I've tasted the Dornishman's wife! Yes I've tasted the Dornishman's wife!",bronn
It's against my code to hurt a woman.,bronn
I wouldn't say you beat me.,bronn
Wonderful. Wouldn't feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar.,bronn
No great hurry. Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world.,bronn
I said Dornish women. I didn't say you.,bronn
I've seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms.,bronn
"Well now, in King's Landing there was an absolutely gorgeous...",bronn
Was I?,bronn
Was there? My memory's not what it was earlier.,bronn
You seem concerned with it. You must really like me.,bronn
My head… You don't even wanna know what's going on in…,bronn
It's nothing. It's the dry air.,bronn
You.,bronn
I'm sorry about the locale.,petyr baelish
No you're not.,olenna tyrell
It felt like the safest place.,petyr baelish
"Not for your clientele, clearly.",olenna tyrell
"It was an establishment like no other. The sheer range of appetites catered to, desires that didn't exist until we invented them.",petyr baelish
"You've always been rather impressed with yourself, haven't you?",olenna tyrell
The past is the past. The future is all that's worth discussing. The future of House Tyrell.,petyr baelish
"Don't pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren, or me. I should have known you'd return to the capital once things started going wrong.",olenna tyrell
I promise you..,petyr baelish
"I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined. Together we murdered a king. And if my house should fall, I would have nothing to hide. And if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market, they'll never even find what's left of you. So do you deny a part in all of this?",olenna tyrell
Cersei summoned me to King's Landing. I dared not refuse her.,petyr baelish
And what did she want?,olenna tyrell
"A piece of info that she know that I had. Neither silence nor lies were an option. But I have other information of which she is unaware. And as you say, our interests are aligned. I have a gift for you.",petyr baelish
What kind of gift?,olenna tyrell
The same kind I gave Cersei. A handsome young man.,petyr baelish
Sitting through the great games will be bad enough.,daenerys targaryen
I think I've seen enough.,daenerys targaryen
I've sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.,daenerys targaryen
What are you doing?,tyrion lannister
Get him out of my sight.,daenerys targaryen
"Khaleesi, please, I just need a moment of your time. I brought you a gift.",jorah mormont
It's true. He has.,tyrion lannister
Who are you?,daenerys targaryen
"I am the gift. It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister.",tyrion lannister
"This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. It's quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind.",cersei lannister
We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods.,cersei lannister
You're upset. You're not thinking clearly. I'll visit again when you've had a chance to calm down.,cersei lannister
"I do hope you change your mind about that. I've been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins.",cersei lannister
"Yes, I'm afraid I must. My son needs me now more than ever.",cersei lannister
"Sleep well, sister.",cersei lannister
Yes.,cersei lannister
Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now?,cersei lannister
Who will stand judge?,cersei lannister
Will you be one of them?,cersei lannister
If one or both of them were to confess before the trial…,cersei lannister
What does The Mother's mercy entail?,cersei lannister
Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.,cersei lannister
I think I may have heard at one point.,cersei lannister
I'm afraid i don't.,cersei lannister
Move. Let me go immediately.,cersei lannister
You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy… I am the queen! Let me go!,cersei lannister
Look at me. Look at my face. It's the last thing you'll see before you die.,cersei lannister
"Your Grace, I want to say--",jorah mormont
You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are?,daenerys targaryen
If only I were otherwise.,tyrion lannister
If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn't I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine,daenerys targaryen
You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.,tyrion lannister
So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?,daenerys targaryen
Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It's too soon to know if you deserve my service.,tyrion lannister
If you'd rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.,daenerys targaryen
"When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least.",tyrion lannister
And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?,daenerys targaryen
Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.,tyrion lannister
I have a very large army and very large dragons.,daenerys targaryen
Killing and politics aren't always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.,tyrion lannister
So you want to advise me. Very well. What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.,daenerys targaryen
I know.,tyrion lannister
Why should the people trust a queen who can't keep her promises?,daenerys targaryen
"Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can't remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you.",tyrion lannister
Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?,tyrion lannister
"Yes, many opportunities.",daenerys targaryen
And did he?,tyrion lannister
No. Not until forced to do so.,daenerys targaryen
"He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him.",tyrion lannister
So I should kill him?,daenerys targaryen
"A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you're going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you're ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do.",tyrion lannister
Remove Ser Jorah from the city.,daenerys targaryen
My son. Let me speak to--,cersei lannister
My face will be the last thing you see before--,cersei lannister
"My name is Lana. I'm an orphan. When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters, and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more.",arya stark
"Iit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart. Now every morning I make my way down to the canals. I pass the fish mongers and the bakers. I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on my way home. Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--",arya stark
"Left onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade.",arya stark
How will she serve him?,arya stark
What will she do there?,arya stark
See what?,arya stark
"Oysters, clams and cockles!",arya stark
Oysters clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles!,arya stark
Best in the city.,arya stark
So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?,arya stark
"If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money.",arya stark
The Many Faced God. You said you didn't know what I would see at the docks.,arya stark
And then what?,arya stark
The charges?,cersei lannister
All lies.,cersei lannister
I wish you'd said it sooner. Any word from Jaime?,cersei lannister
Tell him I need to speak to him.,cersei lannister
"What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king--",cersei lannister
"You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother.",cersei lannister
I can't stay here.,cersei lannister
"Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won't. I made him. I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness.",cersei lannister
Why. Why Theon.,sansa stark
Not Theon. There is no Theon. Reek.,theon greyjoy
"Reek. Why did you tell him, Reek?",sansa stark
"I was helping you. You were trying to escape, there is no escape. Not ever. Theon Greyjoy tried to escape. The master knew. He knows everything. He hunted him, he caught him, he strapped him to a cross, and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left.",theon greyjoy
"Good. If it weren't for you I'd still have a family. If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would.",sansa stark
I deserved everything. I deserve to be Reek. I did terrible things. Turned on Robb. Captured Winterfell. Killed those boys.,theon greyjoy
"They weren't “those boys”, they were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers, you'd know them since they were born.",theon greyjoy
They weren't. They were only--,theon greyjoy
Only what?,sansa stark
I can't..,theon greyjoy
Tell me!,sansa stark
"I can't, not unless the master says...",theon greyjoy
"Tell me, they weren't what?!",sansa stark
They weren't...,theon greyjoy
"Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be dead while you still breathe the air. Tell me to my face Theon, tell me that they weren't your brothers!",sansa stark
They weren't Bran and Rickon! I couldn't find them. It was two farm boys. I killed them and burned them so no one would know.,theon greyjoy
You didn't…?,sansa stark
"Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?",sansa stark
I can't talk to you anymore.,theon greyjoy
"Theon, you have to tell me, do you have any idea where Bran and Rickon--",sansa stark
"Not Theon, Reek!",theon greyjoy
So have you decided yet? Whether I'm worthy of your service?,daenerys targaryen
Have you decided yet whether you're going to have me killed?,tyrion lannister
It's probably my safest option.,daenerys targaryen
I can see why you would think so. It's what your father would have done.,tyrion lannister
And what would your father do?,daenerys targaryen
My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.,tyrion lannister
Is that why you killed him?,daenerys targaryen
"Some day if you decide not to execute me, I'll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we'll need more wine than this.",tyrion lannister
I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name.,daenerys targaryen
"So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers.",tyrion lannister
I'm terrible?,daenerys targaryen
I've heard stories.,tyrion lannister
Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?,daenerys targaryen
To see if you were the right kind of terrible.,tyrion lannister
Which kind is that?,daenerys targaryen
The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.,tyrion lannister
I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.,daenerys targaryen
"Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed.",tyrion lannister
Perhaps it won't come to that.,daenerys targaryen
It's not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.,tyrion lannister
Varys? King Robert's spy master?,daenerys targaryen
Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.,tyrion lannister
Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.,daenerys targaryen
He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn't have to do. I suspect he's the main reason you weren't slaughtered in your crib.,tyrion lannister
But you trust him?,daenerys targaryen
"Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother.",tyrion lannister
The brother who killed my father.,daenerys targaryen
That's the one.,tyrion lannister
Perhaps I will have you killed after all.,daenerys targaryen
"Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting.",tyrion lannister
I'm not going to kill you.,daenerys targaryen
No? Banish me?,tyrion lannister
No.,daenerys targaryen
"So if I'm not going to be murdered, and I'm not going to be banished...",tyrion lannister
You're going to advise me. While you can still speak in complete sentences.,daenerys targaryen
Advise you on what?,tyrion lannister
How to get what I want.,daenerys targaryen
The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.,tyrion lannister
If I want jokes I'll get myself a proper fool.,daenerys targaryen
I'm not entirely joking. There's more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.,tyrion lannister
I fought so that no child born into Slaver's Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.,daenerys targaryen
"And when you get back to your home, who supports you?",tyrion lannister
The common people.,daenerys targaryen
"Let's be generous and assume that's going to happen. Here in Slaver's Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won't back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won't back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough.",tyrion lannister
"Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They're all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground.",daenerys targaryen
It's a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You're not the first person to have dreamt it.,tyrion lannister
I'm not going to stop the wheel. I'm going to break the wheel.,daenerys targaryen
You said whoever wins would fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen. I won.,jorah mormont
I've been flogged if it makes you happy. I'm the best you've got. If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for?,jorah mormont
Let me fight for her and I belong to you.,jorah mormont
"I'll get out of here, you realize. Before long.",cersei lannister
I can make you a wealthy woman. A lady of the court.,cersei lannister
"I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die.",cersei lannister
No.,sam
How are you?,sam
You know what I mean.,sam
Are you scared?,sam
Me too.,sam
Who's there?,sam
Come in.,sam
Not to worry. Men brawl from time to time. It's only natural.,sam
You're a good lad.,sam
Now then. How can I help?,sam
Yes?,sam
We've been fighting them for years.,sam
"Wildlings are people, just like us. There are good ones and bad ones.",sam

"Jon's taking a risk, but he has to. We don't stand a chance otherwise. Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run.",sam
With all my heart.,sam
Try not to worry Olly. I've been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back.,sam
Does that make me a fool?,jon snow
He's not my prisoner.,jon snow
We're allies.,jon snow
We're not here to fight. We're here to talk.,jon snow
My name's Jon Snow. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. We're not friends. We've never been friends. We won't become friends today. This isn't about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what's out there.,jon snow
In normal times we wouldn't. But these aren't normal times. The white walkers don't care if a man's Free Folk or Crow. We're all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.,jon snow
It's not a trick. It's a gift for those who join us.,jon snow
Dragonglass. A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.,jon snow
No. But I trust the man.,jon snow
Come with me and I'll share these weapons.,jon snow
There are good lands south of the wall. The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.,jon snow
"I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We're prepared to give you that new life.",jon snow
If you swear you join us when the real war begins.,jon snow
He died.,jon snow
I put an arrow through his heart.,jon snow
"I'm not asking you to forget your dead. I'll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I'm asking you to think about your children now. They'll never have children of their own if we don't band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can't stop them. The Night's Watch can't stop them. And all the southern kings can't stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we'll give the fuckers a fight.",jon snow
How many are with us? 5000?,jon snow
We're leaving too many behind.,jon snow
And he knew them better than I ever will.,jon snow
Get in line! Get in line!,jon snow
Hold the line! Hold the line!,jon snow
Get them to the ship and come back for me!,jon snow
Now!,jon snow
You should be on one of those boats.,jon snow
You have my word. I've given orders.,jon snow
Night's Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!,jon snow
The Dragonglass!,jon snow
Go! Go! Go!,jon snow
Let's go now! Now!,jon snow
"A band of 20 men, maybe less. They were in and out before anyone spotted them, burnt our food stores to the ground, all our siege weapons were destroyed, dozens of tents were--",davos
Horses?,stannis baratheon

We're not returning to Castle Black.,stannis baratheon
"Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters. But if we can't march forward, and we won't march back…",davos
Have the dead horses butchered for meat.,stannis baratheon
It was a failure.,jon snow
It wasn't.,sam
"I went to save them, I failed.",jon snow
"You didn't fail him, or him, or her. Every one of them is alive because of you, and no one else.",sam
I don't think that fact's lost on them.,jon snow
"You sent for me, Your Grace.",davos
"Find you some healthy horses and a few good men to guard you, I'm sending you back to Castle Black. Tell the Lord Commander to send food, supplies, fresh horses, in return when I take the throne I'll make sure the Night's Watch has all the men it requires. He can guard all 19 castles if he so wishes.",stannis baratheon
"Your Grace, you've named me your Hand.",davos
Yes.,stannis baratheon
"The King's Hand should never abandon the King, especially in a time of war.",davos
"You're not abandoning me, you're obeying a command.",stannis baratheon
A boy with a scroll could deliver this message.,davos
"And if Jon Snow refuses a boy with a scroll, what does the boy say? I didn't name you hand for your expertise in military matters, ride for Castle Black, don't come back empty handed.",stannis baratheon
"Your Grace, perhaps Queen and Princess Shireen could accompany me.",davos
My family stays with me.,stannis baratheon
At least let me take Shireen. A siege is no place for a little girl.,davos
What's this one now?,davos
Well that sounds like a proper story.,davos
"But the dragon only saw a dumb man, holding a mirrored shield.",davos
"Thus ending the dragonslaying career of Ser Byron Swann. I made you something, Princess.",davos
Do you like it?,davos
You're very welcome.,davos
Of course I will.,davos
"Because you deserve it. My son was always on me trying to teach me to read. Gods, I was stubborn about it. Made it this far without reading, seemed to me I could make it to the grave. I wish I had listened to them. This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up. I'll be gone for a few days, Princess. I'll want to hear all about the dance of dragons when I'm back.",davos
Prince Doran.,jaime lannister
Princess Myrcella.,jaime lannister
What a lovely dress.,jaime lannister
You must be cold.,jaime lannister
Prince Trystane. How's your jaw?,jaime lannister
"Looking out for the safety of my niece, the princess Myrcella.",jaime lannister
We received a threatening message. The princess's necklace in the jaws of a viper.,jaime lannister
Ah. Excellent. The last meal before the beheading.,jaime lannister
I'm afraid he does.,jaime lannister
I accept.,jaime lannister
You have my word.,jaime lannister
May I inquire into the fate of my man?,jaime lannister
He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished it's me.,jaime lannister
You're a good man.,jaime lannister
Am I going to be happy at the end of this walk?,bronn
The most beautiful woman in the world.,bronn
"Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.",jaime lannister
Only the one.,bronn
I believe you've already met Prince Trystane.,jaime lannister
Prince. Sorry about the other day.,bronn
Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy. He's agreed to grant you your freedom.,jaime lannister
I'm glad to hear it. The pie looks good.,bronn
There was one condition.,jaime lannister
"Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cock--",arya stark

Three coppers.,arya stark
Here's a silver because the lady likes you.,jon snow
The Thin Man wasn't hungry today.,arya stark
Tomorrow.,arya stark
Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.,jaime lannister
She will.,jaime lannister
"Of course, she's my niece.",jaime lannister
No. What are you reading?,stannis baratheon
What's it about?,stannis baratheon
The dance of dragons”? Why is that a dance?,stannis baratheon
Doesn't make much sense.,stannis baratheon
"If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon, who would you have chosen?",stannis baratheon
"Sometimes a person has to choose. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is not choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it.",stannis baratheon
You don't even know what I'm talking about.,stannis baratheon
Yes there is.,stannis baratheon
Forgive me.,stannis baratheon
There's no other way. She has King's blood.,stannis baratheon
Where have you been?,daenerys targaryen
The smaller man it is.,tyrion lannister
I'm not putting my money anywhere.,daenerys targaryen
"Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you?",daenerys targaryen
There's always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.,tyrion lannister
It's easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.,tyrion lannister
That is greatness?,daenerys targaryen
My father would have liked you.,tyrion lannister
One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.,daenerys targaryen
If need be.,daenerys targaryen
If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason.,daenerys targaryen
Someone else's reason.,daenerys targaryen
"Well said, you're an eloquent man. Doesn't mean you're wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles.",tyrion lannister
"I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious Queen.",jorah mormont
You can end this.,tyrion lannister
You can!,tyrion lannister
Stay close!,tyrion lannister
This way!,jorah mormont
Drogon!,daenerys targaryen
Valahd..,daenerys targaryen
We ride for Winterfell.,stannis baratheon
Prepare to form up.,stannis baratheon
Tell me.,stannis baratheon
How many?,stannis baratheon
Speak up. It can't be worse than mutiny.,stannis baratheon
Cut her down.,stannis baratheon
Get the men into marching formation. On to Winterfell.,stannis baratheon
"He raised his hands. And they all stood up at once. Tens of thousands of them, the biggest army in the world.",jon snow
So what are you gonna do?,sam
I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the wall.,jon snow
But… the Dragonglass?,sam
"No one's ever getting that back, now. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, unless we had a mountain of it.",jon snow
But… you killed a White Walker.,sam
With Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. But Longclaw…,jon snow
He's made of Valyrian steel. How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?,sam
Not enough. The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black?,jon snow
You were friends with me when I first got here. And I wasn't winning any elections back then.,sam
Here's to us then. Long may they sneer.,jon snow
What?,jon snow
"I wanted to ask you something. To ask something of you. Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown so I can become a Maester. That's what I'm meant to be, not this.",sam
"I need you here, Sam. If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust?",jon snow
"Well, there's Edd.",sam
"I'll be more use to you as a Maester. More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon's gone. The Citadel has the worldo s greatest library. I'll learn about history, strategy, healing. And other things. Things that will help when they come.",sam
"If Gilly stays here then she'll die. And the baby that she named after me will die. And I'll end up dying, too, trying to protect them. Which means that the last thing that I'll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them. I'd rather see a thousand White Walkers than see that.",sam
Thank you.,sam
"You know that The Citadel will make you swear off women, too.",jon snow
They'll bloody try.,sam
Sam?,jon snow
What?,sam
Sam…,jon snow
You've just been beaten half to death. How did you--,jon snow
Very carefully.,sam
I'm glad the end of the worldo s working out for someone.,jon snow
I'll come back.,sam
To your return.,jon snow
To my return.,sam
How do you know it's Stannis?,brienne
Trench here. Another one 300 yards from the castle wall. Hurry them along. And send out a foraging party immediately. The siege begins at sunrise.,stannis baratheon
Bolton has women fighting for him.,stannis baratheon
I do not fight for the Boltons. I'm Brienne of Tarth. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face. You murdered him? With blood magic?,brienne
I did.,stannis baratheon
"In the name of Renly of House Baratheon, First of his Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm, I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die. Do you have any last words?",brienne
"Go on, do your duty.",stannis baratheon
Go with her. Please.,theon greyjoy
"I know what Ramsay is. I know what he'll do to me. If I'm going to die, let it happen while there's some of me left.",sansa stark
He's coming back.,theon greyjoy
"You were the first person on my list, you know. For killing Syrio Forel, remember him? Probably not. I've gotten a few of the others. The Many Faced God stole a few more for me. I'm glad he left me you. Do you know who I am?",arya stark
I can't hear you.,arya stark
You know who I am. I'm Arya Stark.,arya stark
Do you know who you are?,arya stark
You're no one. You're nothing.,arya stark
"No! No! No, you don't die! Don't die!",arya stark
He was my friend.,arya stark
But if you're… Who's this?,arya stark
I can't see!,arya stark
What's happening?! What's happening?!,arya stark
Thank you.,jaime lannister
Maybe I'll come visit you sometime.,bronn
Don't wait too long. I've a noble woman to marry back home.,bronn
"Whenever you're ready, My Lord.",jaime lannister
Try not to lose it this time.,jaime lannister
I know you didn't want to leave Dorne. But I'm glad you're coming home. Your mother's desperate to see you. And I'm glad Trystane's coming with us. He seems like a nice boy. You're lucky. Arranged marriages are rarely so… so well arranged.,jaime lannister
"If she sees you're happy, I'm sure she will.",jaime lannister
Have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children?,jaime lannister
"I'm not so sure about that. Listen. There's something I've wanted to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. So. Now that you've seen more of the world, you've learned how complicated things can be. People can be. The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you've fallen in love with Trystane. It was an accident, really, I mean what were the chances? You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry? My point is… we don't choose whom we love. We just… It's beyond our control. I sound like an idiot.",jaime lannister
What I'm trying to say. What I'm trying and failing to say…,jaime lannister
No. I'm afraid you don't.,jaime lannister
Myrcella?,jaime lannister
Myrcella?!,jaime lannister
Myrcella?! Myrcella?!,jaime lannister
"You love her, don't you? How could you not. Of course, it's hopeless for the both of you. Sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight. Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But, we always want the wrong woman.",tyrion lannister
Torgo Nudho.,jorah mormont
Dwarf. I believe that's the word. Apologies. My Valyrian is a bit “nostril”.,tyrion lannister
Rusty” Thank you.,tyrion lannister
None of that matters now. The longer we sit here bantering the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.,jorah mormont
"He's right. The dragon headed north. If we're going to find her, that's where we're to go.",tyrion lannister
We? You're a Lannister. The Queen intends to remove your family from power.,jorah mormont
And I intend to help her do it.,tyrion lannister
You've been here for how many days now? I've fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child.,jorah mormont
You betrayed her!,tyrion lannister
Careful now.,jorah mormont
"And she exiled you, twice, I believe?",tyrion lannister
The second time thanks to you.,jorah mormont
"Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont.",tyrion lannister
"Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep.",tyrion lannister
If I ever kill you your eyes will be wide open.,jorah mormont
Pardon me?,tyrion lannister
"Not precisely, but I have other skills that'd be very useful--",tyrion lannister
I have fought. I don't claim to be a great warrior.,tyrion lannister
Middling.,tyrion lannister
And drink. I've survived so far.,tyrion lannister
He's a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language. Why would the Meereenese listen to him?,jorah mormont
I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.,varys
I suppose there's no point in asking how you found me.,tyrion lannister
"The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east. If one knows how to listen. They tell me you've already found favor with the Mother of Dragons.",varys
"Well, she didn't execute me, so that's a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her, and I'm stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade?",tyrion lannister
Information is the key. You need to learn your enemies' strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.,varys
If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.,tyrion lannister
"If only. A grand old city, choking on violence, corruption, and deceit. Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive, ungainly beast?",varys
I did miss you.,tyrion lannister
"Oh, I know.",varys
We have to go home.,daenerys targaryen
"My poor, sweet thing. Does it hurt? We have to go home. Drogon? Can you take me back to Meereen?",daenerys targaryen
How far did you carry me?,daenerys targaryen
"Drogon, we need to return. My people need me.",daenerys targaryen
"Well, there's no food. At the very least you can hunt us some supper.",daenerys targaryen
"I have sinned. I see that now. How could I have been so blind for so long. I want to be clean again. I want absolution. The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high, and with its holy light--",cersei lannister
"Once I've confessed, will I be free?",cersei lannister
"The Mother have mercy then. I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage, I confess.",cersei lannister
Lancel Lannister.,cersei lannister
I was lonely and afraid.,cersei lannister
A husband of whoring every chance he got.,cersei lannister
May the gods forgive me.,cersei lannister
No.,cersei lannister
I do.,cersei lannister
"A lie. A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon. He wants the Throne, but his brother's children stand in his way, so he claims they are not his brothers'. The filth. There is not one shred of truth to it. I deny it.",cersei lannister
Trial? I have confessed?,cersei lannister
I bow to the wisdom of your High Holiness. But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother's mercy. I haven't seen my son… I don't know how long it's been. I need to see him. Please.,cersei lannister
Thank you. Thank you.,cersei lannister
"I will, I will. I swear it, day and night.",cersei lannister
Am I free to go?,cersei lannister
My atonement?,cersei lannister
He came to your aid. Stannis. Now he needs you!,davos
We don't have enough men to make any difference.,jon snow
The wildlings will make a difference!,davos
"The wildlings won't ever fight for Stannis, I told you before--",jon snow
"You saved their bloody lives. If they're going to live in the Seven Kingdoms, safe behind our wall, they ought to fight for the damn place.",davos
It's not their fight!,jon snow
Stannis?,jon snow
Shireen? The princess?,davos
Are you sure he's talking about Benjen?,jon snow
He could be lying.,jon snow
Where is he?,jon snow
Olly…,jon snow
Help me get him inside,davos
How many of your brothers do you think you can trust?,davos
Does the wolf know you?,davos
We need all the help we can get,davos
"I can't speak for the flames, but he's gone",davos
He'll have seen we didn't come Thorne will have made it official by now Castle Black is his,davos
We don't have the numbers,davos
"It's not enough I didn't know Lord Commander Snow for long, but I have to believe he wouldn't have wanted his friends to die for nothing",davos
"We need to fight, but we don't need to die Not if we have help",davos
You're not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow,davos
We can't stop,theon greyjoy
We have to cross here,theon greyjoy
I can't,sansa stark
It's the only way to throw off the hounds,theon greyjoy
But it's too cold I can't I won't make it I'll die,sansa stark
I've seen what his hounds do to a person This way is better,theon greyjoy
Over here Come on,theon greyjoy
Sansa Sansa,theon greyjoy
Stay here. I'll lure them away,theon greyjoy
"No, I won't make it without you",sansa stark
"You will Go north, only north Jon is Lord Commander at Castle Black He'll help you",theon greyjoy

She broke her leg jumping from the ramparts I left her to die in the snow,theon greyjoy
"Lady Sansa, I offer my services once again I will shield your back and keep your council and give my life for yours if need be I swear it by the old gods and the new",brienne
And I vow...that you shall always have a place by my hearth and…,sansa stark
Meat and mead at my table And I pledge to ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor I swear it by the old gods and the new Arise,sansa stark
Myrcella…,cersei lannister
Do you remember the first time you saw a dead body?,cersei lannister
Mother,jaime lannister
"All I could think about when she died was what would happen to her now Every day, every night, what does Mama look like now? Has she started to bloat? Has her skin turned black? Have her lips peeled back from her teeth?",cersei lannister
I think about locking Myrcella in a crypt,cersei lannister
I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse,cersei lannister
"Shh, shh Don't think about it",jaime lannister
I have to I have to It's not right she has to suffer alone,cersei lannister
She's not suffering She's gone No one can hurt her anymore,jaime lannister
"She was good From her first breath, she was so sweet I don't know where she came from She was nothing like me No meanness, no jealous, just good",cersei lannister
I know,jaime lannister
"I thought if I could make something so good, so pure...maybe I'm not a monster",cersei lannister
Listen -- listen to me She was my daughter and I failed her,jaime lannister
"No, I knew this would happen The witch told me years ago She promised me three children She promised me they'd die “And gold their shrouds” Everything she said came true You couldn't have stopped it It's prophecy It's fate",cersei lannister
You don't believe that,jaime lannister
"Of course I do You told me yourself when Father died You said we had to stay together You said people would try to tear us apart, take what's ours That was a prophecy, too I didn't listen to you, and everything you said came true",cersei lannister
We're never going to fix what's wrong with this city from the top of an 800-foot pyramid,tyrion lannister
We'll be fine We're dressed like common merchants,tyrion lannister
You walk like a rich person,varys
You've spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk?,tyrion lannister
You walk as though the paving stones were your personal property I used to steal from people like you when I was a boy,varys
It's a good thing you're not a boy anymore...because you have no cock,tyrion lannister
For your baby To eat,tyrion lannister
She thinks you want to eat her baby,varys
"His Valyrian is terrible He only wants to give you money, so your baby can eat",varys
Mhysa means mother in Valyrian,varys
I know what mhysa means,tyrion lannister
Who wrote it?,varys
Hard to know Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be,tyrion lannister
The Sons of the Harpy?,varys
"Very possibly Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property, told them human beings weren't even property to begin with You can see why they're unhappy Of course, it could also be the freed men",tyrion lannister
Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them,tyrion lannister
She did fly away on a dragon and not come back,varys
It's a problem,tyrion lannister
"Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill Whoever you are, wherever you go, someone in this city wants to murder you We can't fight an enemy we don't know",tyrion lannister
"The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack in the fighting pits very carefully, which means they take orders from someone",varys
And have you started looking for that someone?,tyrion lannister
"My little birds have already taken wing Soon they'll return, singing songs of men in gold masks",varys
"Well, we won't be sailing to Westeros anytime soon",tyrion lannister

And some mutton I'd like some mutton,davos

Apologies for what you're about to see,davos
Get out of my way,cersei lannister
What are the king's orders?,cersei lannister
You're barring me from attending my own daughter's funeral?,cersei lannister
I would like to speak to my son,cersei lannister
Almost,jaime lannister
Your mother wouldn't do that,jaime lannister
Are you angry with her?,jaime lannister
Then why didn't you let her come? She has every right to be here,jaime lannister
"They're not putting your mother in a cell ever again Not while I'm here Why haven't you gone to see her? Everything she endured, she did it for you",jaime lannister

Go and see your mother and ask her to forgive you,jaime lannister
"Go and see your mother, Tommen",jaime lannister
You're a bold man,jaime lannister
You must long for the next life,jaime lannister
You imprisoned and humiliated my sister,jaime lannister
What about my sins?,jaime lannister
"I broke a sacred oath and stabbed my king in the back I killed my own cousin When the gods judged my brother guilty, I helped him escape their justice What atonement do I deserve?",jaime lannister
"Oh, the gods won't mind They've spilled more blood than the rest of us combined",jaime lannister
They should be closer if you mean for them to save you,jaime lannister
I've fought against worse odds,jaime lannister

What about the dragons? We have two of them here beneath the pyramid,tyrion lannister
"Daenerys is the dragon queen Can't very well let the dragons starve, that's obvious",tyrion lannister
Dragons do not do well in captivity,tyrion lannister
That's what I do I drink and I know things,tyrion lannister
"The dragons Aegon used to conquer Westeros ranged over hundreds of miles Then Daenerys's ancestors started chaining them up in pens A few generations later, the last dragons were no larger than cats They must be unchained or they'll waste away Missandei, how many times were you in the company of these dragons?",tyrion lannister
And did they ever harm you?,tyrion lannister
Dragons are intelligent More intelligent than men according to some maesters They have affection for their friends and fury for their enemies I am their friend,tyrion lannister
Do they know that?,varys
They will It's time they had their supper,tyrion lannister
I'm friends with your mother I'm here to help Don't eat the help,tyrion lannister
"When I was a child an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day I begged him for one of you “It wouldn't even have to be a big dragon,” I told him “It could be little, like me”",tyrion lannister
Everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard Then my father told me the last dragon had died a century ago I cried myself to sleep that night,tyrion lannister

I'm not asking the Lord of Light for helpI'm asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist,davos
Have you ever tried?,davos
"Easy, easy Easy",davos
What do you remember?,davos
They stabbed me Olly...he put a knife in my heart I shouldn't be here,jon snow
The lady brought you back.,davos
Nothing There was nothing at all,jon snow
Could you give us a moment?,davos
"You were dead And now you're not That's completely fucking mad, seems to me I can only imagine how it seems to you",davos
I did what I thought was right And I got murdered for it And now I'm back Why?,jon snow
I don't know Maybe we'll never know What does it matter? You go on You fight for as long as you can You clean up as much of the shit as you can,davos
"I don't know how to do that I thought I did, but...I failed",jon snow
Good Now go fail again,davos
I'm not a god,jon snow
I think so Hold off on burning my body for now,jon snow
What are you doing?! Take your hands off me! I will have your heads!,daenerys targaryen
You have made a mistake One you will regret I am the wife of the Great Khal,daenerys targaryen
"Because I am Daenerys Stormborn, the Breaker of Chains, the Queen of Meereen and the Mother of Dragons My place is not here with you",daenerys targaryen
Where else would I go? Every khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen,daenerys targaryen
I don't know how you stand it in all that leather,varys
If we could have the room,varys
"You look lovely today, my dear You really do How you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat",varys
I am not a torturer,varys
Though it so often is what people deserve,varys
"And it does provide answers But they're usually the wrong answers My job is to find the right answers Do you know how I do that? I do it by making people happy I'd like to make you happy, Vala That's your name, isn't it, Vala?",varys
"That's all right I know who you are and what you've done You've done a lot You've sacrificed your body for a cause, which is more than most people do And you've helped the Sons of the Harpy murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons",varys
"I understand Well, that makes perfect sense from your perspective I have a different perspective, of course I think it's important that you try to see things from my perspective just as I will try to see them from yours Because that is the only way that I can make you and Dom happy That is how you pronounce it -- Dom? I'm afraid I don't really speak the language Such a handsome boy Those big, brown eyes Good luck keeping the ladies away",varys
"Children are blameless I have never hurt them Your boy is in no immediate danger, this I swear to you But between us, dear, you did conspire to kill the queen's soldiers We both know the penalty for that crime How will poor Dom get on without his mother? And with his breathing problem",varys
"Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem There is a third option, though A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos I've already booked passage for a woman and her young son I'll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again",varys
Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it Far too heavy for me The boat sails at dawn You need to decide now A new life for you and Dom or…,varys
"What should we do while we wait? To pass the time, what should we do? What should we talk about?",tyrion lannister
You speak 19 languages You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things,tyrion lannister
"You two, you spend a great deal of time together What would you be talking about if I weren't here?",tyrion lannister
That's good That's very good,tyrion lannister
But that's a report I was thinking more of a conversation A wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms,tyrion lannister
"Me Just now All right, no conversations Let's play a game",tyrion lannister
"You don't play games, either one of you, ever?",tyrion lannister
"There, that's a start",tyrion lannister
"Oh no, no, no Not that, of course not that Innocent games, fun games, drinking games",tyrion lannister
Until you do,tyrion lannister
"Alright No drinking We can play without drinking It's a wonderful game I invented it Here's how it works I make a statement about your past If I'm wrong, I drink And if I'm right -- Maybe we can't play without drinking",tyrion lannister
"Oh, you took your time",tyrion lannister
Sorry I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy Some things you can't rush,varys
The good masters of Astapor And the wise masters of Yunkai With help from their friends in Volantis,varys
You see? You don't even have to worry about the local rebellion We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it,tyrion lannister
"If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Asatapor and Yunkai, who remain to defend the free people of Meereen?",tyrion lannister
You may be right,tyrion lannister
Possibly,tyrion lannister
It's a conversation,tyrion lannister
"Tell me, can the little birds get a message to the good Masters of Astapor, the wise Masters of Yunkai, the benevolent enslavers of Volantis",tyrion lannister
"Of course Man can be fickle, but birds always trust",varys
Varys's little birds,cersei lannister
What did you do to him exactly I haven't been able to get a clear answer,jaime lannister
"Does he understand what we're saying I mean, to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place",jaime lannister
So tell him to march into the sept and crush the High Sparrow's head like a melon,jaime lannister
The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him Ser Gregor will can't face them all And he won't have to He'll only have to face one,cersei lannister
Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?,jaime lannister
Not yet,cersei lannister
That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching,jaime lannister
"Don't stop at the city I want little birds in Dorne, in Highgarden, in the North If someone is planning on making our losses their gains I want to hear it If someone is laughing at the queen who walk naked through the streets covered in shit, I want to hear I want to know who they are I want to where they are",cersei lannister
Why are you here,cersei lannister
Thank you for bringing it up It's well past time we addressed the abuses I endured,cersei lannister
I'm Lord Commander of the Kingsguard The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard does have a position on the Small Council,jaime lannister
"Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement?",cersei lannister
"What about Myrcella's death, Uncle? Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue?",cersei lannister
The same women who murdered Myrcella have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne We've got a lot to discuss All of us together,jaime lannister
"And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it",cersei lannister

My watch is ended,jon snow

I did everything I could You know that,jon snow

This is good soup Do you remember those kidney pies Old Nan used to make?,sansa stark
With the peas and onions?,jon snow
Mmm,sansa stark
We never should have left Winterfell,jon snow
"Don't you wish we could go back to the day we left? I want to scream at myself, “Don't go, you idiot”",sansa stark
How could we know?,jon snow
I spent a lot of time thinking about what as ass I was to you I wish I could change everything,sansa stark
We were children,jon snow
"I was awful, just admit it",sansa stark
You were occasionally awful I'm sure I can't have been great fun Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played,jon snow
Can you forgive me?,sansa stark
There's nothing to forgive,jon snow
Forgive me,sansa stark
"All right All right, I forgive you",jon snow
"You'd think after thousands of years, the Night's Watch would have learned how to make a good ale",jon snow
Where will you go?,sansa stark
"Where will we go? If I don't watch over you, Father's ghost will come back and murder me",jon snow
Where will we go?,sansa stark
"I can't stay here, not after what happened",jon snow
There's only one place we can go Home,sansa stark
Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave?,jon snow
We'll take it back from them,sansa stark
I don't have an army,jon snow
How many wildlings did you save?,sansa stark
They didn't come here to serve me,jon snow
They owe you their lives,sansa stark
You think they'll be safe here if Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?,sansa stark
Sansa,jon snow
"Winterfell is our home It's ours and Arya's and Bran's and Rickon's Wherever they are, it belongs to our family We have to fight for it",sansa stark
I'm tired of fighting,jon snow
It's all I've done since I left home I've killed brothers of the Night's Watch I've killed wildlings I've killed men that I admire I hanged a boy younger than Bran I fought and I lost,jon snow
"If we don't take back the North, we'll never be safe I want you to help me But I'll do it myself if I have to",sansa stark
My lady,davos
Will you stay here at Castle Black?,davos
You serve Jon Snow now?,davos
"Forgive me, my lady, I thought that was Stannis",davos
What happened down there?,davos
And Shireen? What happened to the princess?,davos
I saw what happened I saw Stannis' forces defeated in the field,brienne
"My lady, I'm Ser Davos Seaworth",davos
We've met before I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon Before Renly was assassinated with bloodmagic,brienne
That's in the past now,davos
"Yes, it's in the past It doesn't mean I forget Or forgive He admitted it, you know",brienne
Who did?,davos
Stannis Just before I executed him,brienne
The Defender of the Vale!,petyr baelish
My lord Come and see,petyr baelish
I missed your name day Go on,petyr baelish
A gyrfalcon The greatest and rarest of birds,petyr baelish
Indeed I was,petyr baelish
"On our way to the Fingers, we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men Seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting",petyr baelish
"Tell me, Lord Royce, how many people knew of my travel plans with Sansa Stark? I shared my intentions with you and no one else",petyr baelish
Your home is the Vale The Lord of the Vale stands before us And only his judgment concerns me,petyr baelish
"Lord Royce has served the Vale well He;s enjoyed a distinguished military career If we could trust his absolute loyalty, he would make a capable commander in the wars to come",petyr baelish
I think he deserves one more chance What do you say?,petyr baelish
"I bring good news My friends in the North tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell I expect she's headed to Castle Black where her brother serves as Lord Commander But she won't be safe there, not with the Boltons after her",petyr baelish
That was my instinct as well,petyr baelish
Our lord has spoken Gather the Knights of the Vale The time has come to join the fray,petyr baelish
"I did As a clever man once told me, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends”",tyrion lannister
"Yes, that's the military approach And how has that worked here in Meereen? I represent the diplomatic approach",tyrion lannister
We enter these negotiations with open eyes Trust me My own recent experience with slavery has taught me the horrors of that institution,tyrion lannister
Long enough to know,tyrion lannister
And now you speak for the Good Masters of AstaporHere's to reversals of fortune,tyrion lannister
"Let's make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want",tyrion lannister
Queen Daenerys won't stay in Meereen forever Her path takes her westward,tyrion lannister
"Friends, friends, friends, please",tyrion lannister
There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing That is the way of the world I'm not here to change the way of the world,tyrion lannister
You don't need slaves to make money There haven't been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it So here is the queen's proposal Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slaver's Bay time to adjust to the new order,tyrion lannister
"Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice",tyrion lannister
"Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses, of course, at fair prices In exchange, you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy",tyrion lannister
"Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same I do hope you accept, my friends You will not receive a better offer",tyrion lannister
Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it And as a parting gift to our honored guests…,tyrion lannister
Give freedom a chance See if it doesn't taste every bit as good as what came before,tyrion lannister
My friends! Large sorry...you wait so fat time,tyrion lannister
Excellent,tyrion lannister
I did,tyrion lannister
I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled,tyrion lannister
But I am not your ruler I'm not the Breaker of Chains I'm not the Unburnt And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons,tyrion lannister
Because our queen chose me as her advisor Until she returns from her travels --,tyrion lannister
Soon You have my word,tyrion lannister
"And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations As commander of the Unsullied, he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace",tyrion lannister
We offered terms,tyrion lannister
Those men respect you,tyrion lannister
As do I,tyrion lannister
I am not betraying her work I am trying to save her city,tyrion lannister
For a short time,tyrion lannister
You're right Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once War is a horror that should be ended at once I can't do both today,tyrion lannister
I don't trust the Masters I trust their self-interest They're trustworthy if they're convinced that working with me is in their self-interest,tyrion lannister
They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast Their contempt is their weakness They'll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage,tyrion lannister
I'm fine,jorah mormont
What?,jorah mormont
Makes me sad You'll disappoint her before long She'll move on,jorah mormont
We need each other right now After we're done needing each other --,jorah mormont
"You didn't get much discipline as a child, did you?",jorah mormont
"The road running through the Horse Gate, they call that the godsway",jorah mormont
"Eastern Market, Western Market When Khal Drogo died, she was supposed to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen, the widows of the dead khals That's where they would have taken her, the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen",jorah mormont
It's forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city,jorah mormont
"If they spot us and we're unarmed, we'll say we're traders heading for the Western Market But if they see weapons…",jorah mormont
"There's 100,000 of them down there We can't fight our way out We wait till dark, and then we'll find her",jorah mormont
Don't worry it didn't touch you,jorah mormont
I know what happens,jorah mormont
Come on,jorah mormont
My friends...We wandered off from the Western Market and got lost Could you show us the way back?,jorah mormont
"Wine Come down to my stall tomorrow, I'll give you a cask of the Arbor's finest",jorah mormont
"If they find a body with a stab wound, the whole city will be looking for us",jorah mormont
That is more than most have,daenerys targaryen
I need to make water,daenerys targaryen
I will never run from Dothraki,daenerys targaryen
I needed fresh air The old women stink,daenerys targaryen
You must have been very young when your Khal died,daenerys targaryen
Too bad he didn't die sooner,daenerys targaryen
Mm-hmm,daenerys targaryen
They do Would you like to see them one day?,daenerys targaryen
"No, don't hurt her",daenerys targaryen
We have to go now,jorah mormont
We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive,daenerys targaryen
All we can do is try,jorah mormont
No We can do more than that And you're going to help me,daenerys targaryen
"And you...Have faith in me, Khaleesi Do not betray me",daenerys targaryen
is walking down the hall to TOMMEN's chamber. She hears MAESTER PYCELLE talking.,cersei lannister
enters the room,cersei lannister
What are you doing here?,cersei lannister
Leave.,cersei lannister
Is this a Small Council meeting?,cersei lannister
"Since I've missed the past several Small Coucil meetings, I wanted to speak to you about a few things.",cersei lannister
"As have we all, unfortunately.",cersei lannister
Look at me. What did they do to me? To the king's own mother?,cersei lannister
It's all right. It's done. It's in the past. And of course Margaery's safety is paramount.,cersei lannister
"Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant. Margaery is the queen. Queens must command respect. Kings even more so. Not just for their own sake, but for everyone's. The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens. No respect for anything in this world. He has no use for the things of this world. He want to knock them down and replace them with what? With fantasies. With beggars in the street. With nothing.",cersei lannister
You've spoken with him?,cersei lannister
"It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly, given his constant prattling about the truth. I am your mother. You can always trust me.",cersei lannister
The Small Council meeting has been postponed on the king's orders.,cersei lannister
You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one's rivals.,cersei lannister
Cersei is the mother of the king. She has the king's ear and his trust. And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.,jaime lannister
"The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back. Here we are. Well done to us. Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty, peasant hands. In a few days, he'll have a trial for me. But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement. Yes, Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city.",cersei lannister
I agree.,cersei lannister
"You've got the second largest army in Westeros. You'll bring them into the city, stop queen Margaery's humiliation before it starts, and take her back into Crown custody.",jaime lannister
"You'll take no action at all. When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down. Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?",jaime lannister
"The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything. When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery's back at Tommen's side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?",jaime lannister
You hate these fanatics as much as we do. You hate what they've done to your son. Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good?,cersei lannister
Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.,cersei lannister

That's all right. There are more important things.,sansa stark
I'm not Lord Commander anymore.,jon snow
SNOW takes the letter. The man leaves. JON SNOW sees the seal of House Bolton. He opens the scroll and starts reading.,jon snow
"To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow. You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall. You have betrayed your own kind. You have betrayed the North. Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see. Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon.",jon snow
SNOW looks at SANSA.,jon snow
"His direwolf's skin is on my floor. Come and see. I want my bride back. Send her to me, bastard, and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers. Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection. You will watch as I skin them living. You --",jon snow
Go on.,sansa stark
It's just more of the same.,jon snow
"SNOW puts the letter away, but SANSA takes it and continues reading.",jon snow
"You will watch as my soldiers take turns raping your sister. You will watch as my dogs your wild little brother. Then I will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest. Come and see. Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.",sansa stark
Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.,jon snow
His father's dead. Ramsay killed him. And now he has Rickon.,sansa stark
We don't know that.,jon snow
"Yes, we do.",sansa stark
"I heard him say 5,000 once when he was talking about Stannis's attack.",sansa stark
How many do you have?,jon snow
You're the son of the last true Warden of the North. Northern families are loyal. They'll fight for you if you ask.,sansa stark
A monster has taken our home and our brother. We have to go back to Winterfell and save them both.,sansa stark
SNOW nods.,jon snow
"enters, ushered by the Lhazareen woman and the leader of the Dosh Khaleen. The khals bow their heads.",daenerys targaryen
Don't you want to know what I think?,daenerys targaryen
No. I don't want either of those things.,daenerys targaryen
I know where I am. I have been here before. This is where the Dosh Khaleen pronounced my child the Stallion Who Mounts the World.,daenerys targaryen
This is where Drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends. To ride wooden horses across the Black Salt Sea as no khal has done before. He promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses. He swore to me before the Mother of Mountains.,daenerys targaryen
"And here, now, what great matters do the Great Khals discuss? Which little villages you'll raid, how many girls you'll get to fuck, how many horses you'll demand in tribute. You are small men. None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki. But I am. So I will.",daenerys targaryen
lays her hand on a fire pit.,daenerys targaryen
You're not going to serve. You're going to die.,daenerys targaryen
"knocks down all the fire pits one by one. The khals cower away from the flame. The flame begins to cover the entire temple. The khals run to the door and try to escape, but the door has been barred. JORAH and DAARIO watch the temple burning from the outside. The Dothraki people gather around the burning temple. DAENERYS grabs the final fire pit and knocks it in KHAL MORO's direction. The fire engulfs the entire temple and kills all the khals. DAENERYS walks out of the fire, unharmed and naked. All the Dothraki bow to DAENERYS. JORAH and DAARIO walk up to the steps burning temple. JORAH bows to DAENERYS. DAARIO stares at her and then bows.",daenerys targaryen
Yes?,sansa stark
How far is Mole's Town?,sansa stark
"Sansa. Lady Brienne. When I heard you had escaped WInterfell, I feared the worst. You have no idea how happy I am to see you unharmed.",petyr baelish
Unharmed? What are you doing here?,sansa stark
I rode north with the Knights of the Vale to come to your aid. They're encamped at Moat Cailin as we speak.,petyr baelish
"To come to my aid? Did you know about Ramsay? If you didn't know, you're an idiot. If you did know, you're my enemy.",sansa stark
"Would you like to hear about our wedding night? He never hurt my face. He needed my face, the face of Ned Stark's daughter. But the rest of me, he did what he liked with the rest of me as long as I could still give him an heir. What do you think he did?",sansa stark
I can't begin to contemplate --,petyr baelish
What do you think he did to me?,sansa stark
Lady Sansa asked you a question.,brienne
He beat you.,petyr baelish
"Yes, he enjoyed that. What else do you think he did?",sansa stark
"Sansa, I --",petyr baelish
What else?,sansa stark
Did he cut you?,petyr baelish
Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.,sansa stark
I didn't know.,petyr baelish
I thought you knew everyone's secrets.,sansa stark
"I made a mistake, a horrible mistake. I underestimated a stranger.",petyr baelish
"The other things he did, ladies aren't supposed to talk about those things, but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time. I can still feel it. I don't mean in my tender heart it still pains me so. I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now.",sansa stark
I'm so sorry.,petyr baelish
You said you would protect me.,sansa stark
And I will. You must believe me when I tell you that I will.,petyr baelish
I don't believe you anymore. I don't need you anymore. You can't protect me. You won't even be able to protect yourself if I tell Brienne to cut you down. And why shouldn't I?,sansa stark
"Do you want me to beg for my life? If that's what you want, I will. Whatever you ask that is in my power, I will do.",petyr baelish
What if I want you to die here and now?,sansa stark
Then I will die.,petyr baelish
You freed me from the monsters who murdered my family and you gave me to other monsters who murdered my family. Go back to Moat Cailin. My brother and I will take back the North on our own. I never want to see you again.,sansa stark
I would do anything to undo what's been done to you. I know that I can't. Will you allow me to say one more thing before I go? Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish has gathered what remains of the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun. You might consider seeking him out. The time may come when you need an army loyal to you.,petyr baelish
I have an army.,sansa stark
Your brother's army.,petyr baelish

For now is the best we get in our profession.,varys
It's not enough.,tyrion lannister
"Considering the city was on the brink of civil war, I'd say it's a good start.",varys
"It's not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and...all that.",tyrion lannister
"Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced.",tyrion lannister
Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?,varys
Who said anything about “him”?,tyrion lannister
Welcome to Meereen.,tyrion lannister
That's about the extent of my Valyrian.,tyrion lannister
Thank you for travelling all this way. I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.,tyrion lannister
The truth is we need your help. We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to --,tyrion lannister
Yes.,tyrion lannister
She did indeed.,tyrion lannister
Ideally we'd avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.,tyrion lannister
I'd settle for obeyed.,tyrion lannister
That sounds most excellent --,tyrion lannister
"A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses. He, too, had a glorious destiny. He attacked King's Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me. Last I had heard, he'd been defeated again, this time at Winterfell and this time for good.",varys
We'd be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.,tyrion lannister
I suppose it's hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake. Isn't that the whole point of being a fanatic? You're always right. Everything is the Lordo s will.,varys
"And you, an honest servant of the lord, why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis?",varys
"My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen.",tyrion lannister
"We can't defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men.",jon snow
"Aside from the Starks and the Boltons, the most powerful houses in the North are the Umbers, the Karstarks, and the Manderlys.",davos
"The Umbers and the Karstarks have already declared for the Boltons, so we're not doing so well there.",davos
The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. They can hang. But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay without knowing they had another choice.,sansa stark
"I beg your pardon, my lady, but they know that a Stark beheaded their father. I don't think we can count on them either.",davos
"How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?",sansa stark
"Precious little, my lady.",davos
"My father always said Northerners are different. More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders.",sansa stark
"They may well be loyal, but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family? I may not know the North, but I know men. They're more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don't want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause. If Jon's going to convince them to fight alongside him, they need to believe it's a fight they can win.",davos
"There are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood. Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others. We can start small and build.",jon snow
"The North remembers. They remember the Stark name. People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door.",sansa stark
I don't doubt it. But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.,davos
"No, but I do.",sansa stark
"Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark's son as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's. Ant there are also the Tullys. They're not Northern, but they will back us against the Boltons without question.",sansa stark
I didn't know the Tullys still had an army.,davos
My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun.,sansa stark
How do you know that?,jon snow
Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.,sansa stark
"That's good. The Blackfish is a legend. His support would mean a great deal. Stark, Tully, a few more houses, almost starts to look like a winning side.",davos
"I've sworn to protect you, my lady.",brienne
You heard them. We need more men and my uncle has an army.,sansa stark
We can send the Blackfish a raven.,brienne
Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it. It has to be you.,sansa stark
Ride for Riverrun. My uncle will talk to you and you'll know how to talk to him.,sansa stark
What is it?,sansa stark
I don't like leaving you here alone.,brienne
With Jon?,sansa stark
"Not him. He seems trustworthy. A bit brooding, perhaps. I suppose that's understandable, considering. The others, though. Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic. And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they? Already out looking for a leader with better prospects. And that wildling fellow with the beard --",brienne
"Jon isn't Tormund. Jon isn't Davos, the Red Woman, or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon. He's my brother. He'll keep me safe. I trust him.",sansa stark
Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?,brienne
New dress?,jon snow
I made it myself. Do you like it?,sansa stark
"Year, it's -- I like the wolf bit.",jon snow
"Good, because I made this for you.",sansa stark
I made it like the one Father used to wear. As near as I can remember.,sansa stark
"Thank you, Sansa.",jon snow
You're welcome.,sansa stark
Don't knock it down while I'm gone.,jon snow
"Oh, yes. Once you get south of the Riverlands, very different sorts of trees start to take over. Maple, elm, beech, poplar. The odd willow. And of course now that summer's over, you'll start seeing the autumn colors coming in. Still, you'll find more green here than anywhere else.",sam
"I didn't think I'd ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn't. A person just doesn't feel welcome at that point.",sam
And I certainly didn't expect to be introducing him to my family. So you know what to tell them.,sam
"Yes, now that's very important. If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he'll take you in. He'll get an education. He'll learn to read. And you can help teach him. Huh?",sam
I told them I met you in the North.,sam
"Well, it wasn't a very large piece of parchment.",sam
"The thing is...my father doesn't like wildlings. He hoped I'd make a man of myself by “killing some bloody wildlings,” so it's probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible.",sam
"Oh, hello, Mother.",sam
Oh.,sam
"Talla? Gods, you're a woman now.",sam
"Oh, um, Mother, this is Gilly.",sam
"Oh, and this, this is our son Samwell.",sam
Where is Father? And Dickon?,sam
It's beautiful. You're beautiful.,sam
"This venison, it's very tasty. Is it from today's hunt?",sam
"Oh, of course. Sorry. Long journey.",sam
"Oh, that's a fair distance.",sam
"Oh, yes. Yes. A good amount. North of the Wall, you don't hunt, you don't eat.",sam
"Rabbits. Sometimes squirrels. I say “we,” it's my friend Jon mostly. Sometimes Edd. Oh, and Gilly. She's- - she's quite a good hunter as well. Um, huntress.",sam
"Oh, yes. Yes, please. Thank you, Mother.",sam
I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander. He wants me to- -,sam
"Yes. And once I have my chain, I'll return to Castle Black.",sam
Gilly.,sam
I'm sorry I let him treat you that way. I was afraid he'd turn you and Little Sam away.,sam
First light.,sam
Say good-bye to him for me.,sam
"Good-bye, Gilly.",sam
We're leaving.,sam
Get your things.,sam
We belong together. All of us.,sam
"Oh, they'll understand.",sam
She won't mind. Looks better on you anyway.,sam
It's my family's sword.,sam
He can bloody well try.,sam
Nothing.,arya stark
Three times.,arya stark
No.,arya stark
You're very good.,arya stark
"So change it. It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you.",arya stark
The queen loves her son more than anything. And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye. She wouldn't just cry. She would be angry. She would want to kill the person who did this to her.,arya stark
Mercy.,arya stark
I have to go. My father's waiting for me.,arya stark
Careful of that one. She wants you dead.,arya stark
My lord.,jaime lannister
Sorry to interrupt. We're here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell. Give them to us and we'll be on our way.,jaime lannister
"I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name.",jaime lannister
You already insulted one great house. It won't happen twice. Every last sparrow will die before Margaery walks down that street.,jaime lannister
He's beaten us. That's what's happening.,olenna tyrell
I've been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born. You don't have to do this. You don't have to do anything.,jaime lannister
Not when you're sitting in that chair.,jaime lannister
Will I be walking naked in the streets? Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods' mercy?,jaime lannister
I'm being sent to deal with the Blackfish. Apparently Walder Frey can't manage it on his own because he's 400 years old. Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months.,jaime lannister
BEtter you're elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons.,cersei lannister
I'm not going to the Riverlands.,jaime lannister
"What, then?",cersei lannister
I'm going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone's ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows. I'll take them to the sept and I'll remove the High Sparrow's head and every other sparrow head I can find.,jaime lannister
You can't.,cersei lannister
He has our son! He stole our son! He's torn our family apart. How should we treat people who tear us apart?,jaime lannister
"We should treat them without mercy and we will. But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won't leave the sept alive. And without you, this is all for nothing. Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you. Show our men where their loyalties belong. Show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies. And take that stupid little castle back because it's ours and because you can.",cersei lannister
You'll stand trial soon. I need to he here for you.,jaime lannister
"It will be a trial by combat. I have the Mountain. They've made us both stronger, all of them.",cersei lannister
They have no idea how strong we are. No idea what we're going to do to them.,cersei lannister
We've always been together. We'll always be together. We're the only two people in the world.,cersei lannister
How many days' ride to Meereen?,daenerys targaryen
How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?,daenerys targaryen
And who has that many?,daenerys targaryen
Nobody yet.,daenerys targaryen
I take what is mine.,daenerys targaryen
What was I made for?,daenerys targaryen
Wait here.,daenerys targaryen
Every khal who ever lived chose three blood riders to fight beside him and guard his way. But I am not a khal. I will not choose three blood riders. I choose you all.,daenerys targaryen
I will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar! Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea?,daenerys targaryen
Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses?,daenerys targaryen
"Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms, the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains?",daenerys targaryen
Are you with me?,daenerys targaryen
Now and always?,daenerys targaryen
Does it move or talk? I want to speak with you alone.,olenna tyrell
"Oh, this is madness!",olenna tyrell
"You're not in your sanctuary now, my dear. All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about...",olenna tyrell
until I tell them to stop. If I tell them to stop. You could use a good bashing.,olenna tyrell
What have they done to you?,olenna tyrell
We marched for you.,olenna tyrell
And what about your brother? What mercy did they show him?,olenna tyrell
Have you lost your mind?,olenna tyrell
"He is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell.",olenna tyrell
As a mindless fanatic.,olenna tyrell
You will leave for Highgarden today. There is no law that says you must stay here.,olenna tyrell
I will never leave you. Never.,olenna tyrell
"I'll see you soon, my dear.",olenna tyrell
"That's what'll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you're here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they'll come for you. You're right. This isn't your fight. You shouldn't have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn't be asking you. It's not the deal we made. I need you with me if we're gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you're going to survive.",jon snow
Are you sure they'll come?,jon snow
I heard you were leaving King's Landing.,cersei lannister
That is hardly your concern.,olenna tyrell
Your grandson is still a prisoner. You'll leave him rotting in a cell?,cersei lannister
Loras rots in a cell because of you. THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you. Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.,olenna tyrell
You're right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day.,cersei lannister
Good.,olenna tyrell
I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. And now we must fight them together. We need each other.,cersei lannister
"I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met. At a certain age, it's hard to recall. But the truly vile do stand out through the years. Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells? I do. I'll never forget it.",olenna tyrell
You love your granddaughter. I love my son. It's the only truth I know. We must defend them.,cersei lannister
"I'm leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells. If you're half as bright as you think you are, you'll find your way out of here, too.",olenna tyrell
Never. I'll never leave my son.,cersei lannister
"What'll you do, then? You have no support. Not anymore. Your brother's gone. The High Sparrow saw to that. The rest of your family have abandoned you. The people despise you. You're surrounded by enemies, thousands of them. You're going to kill them all by yourself? You've lost, Cersei. It's the only joy I can find in all this misery.",olenna tyrell
"Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege. Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches.",bronn
Someone certainly does.,jaime lannister
"Oh, no. Not me. I'm just an upjumped sellsword.",bronn
You're an anointed knight. There's quite a difference.,jaime lannister
"Aye, knights don't get paid.",bronn
You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.,jaime lannister
That's like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.,bronn
I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long. You can be the right hand I lost.,jaime lannister
You promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife.,bronn
And you'll get all three. A Lannister always- -,jaime lannister
Don't say it. Don't fucking say it.,bronn
"Lothar, is it?",jaime lannister
"Cause you didn't set up a proper perimeter. You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged.",jaime lannister
Good thing we're friends or we'd be fucking you in the ass right now.,bronn
Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.,jaime lannister
"Only a fool makes threats he's not prepared to carry out. Now let's say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking. What do you think I'd do?",jaime lannister
I'm here by the king's command to take back this castle. Have him bathed and fed. Unless you'd like to take his place.,jaime lannister
"The siege is now under my command. The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts, he'll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is.",jaime lannister
Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches. Set pickets every hundred yards. And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.,bronn
"As I said, the siege is under my command. If that's not to your liking, go home.",jaime lannister
Get word to the Blackfish. I want a parley.,jaime lannister
A parley or a fight?,bronn
He's an old man.,jaime lannister
You've got one hand. My money's on the old boy.,bronn
Lady Mormont.,jon snow
"I remember when you were born, my lady. You were named for my Aunt Lyanna. It was said she was a great beauty. I'm sure you will be, too.",sansa stark
"I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact- -",jon snow
Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- -,jon snow
"Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont's allegiance.",jon snow
"I did what I had to do to survive, my lady. But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark.",sansa stark
"Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him. Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that- -",jon snow
"If it please, my lady, I understand how you feel.",davos
"Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth.",davos
You needn't ask your maester about my house. It's rather new.,davos
"You never thought you'd find yourself in your position. Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age. I never thought I'd be in my position. I was a crabber's son, then I was a smuggler. And now I found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war. But I'm here because this isn't someone else's war. It's our war.",davos
"Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward. He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life. Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn't between a few squabbling houses. It's between the living and the dead. And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming.",davos
Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.,jon snow
"As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided. And a divided North won't stand a chance against the Night King. You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand. But there's no hiding from this. We have to fight and we need to do it together.",davos
"Thank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect?",jon snow
62?,jon snow
"If they're half as ferocious as their lady, the Boltons are doomed.",davos
Blackfish.,jaime lannister
I don't have them.,jaime lannister
"You know why I'm here. This castle belongs to House Frey. You're trespassing. In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or- -",jaime lannister
It won't stop with Edmure. You'll force me to storm the castle. Hundreds will die.,jaime lannister
"We'll breach them and kill every last one of you. But if you surrender, I'll spare the lives of your men. On my honor.",jaime lannister
"The war is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?",jaime lannister
You clearly have no intention of saving your men's lives. Why did you come to treat with me?,jaime lannister
"Well, now you have.",jaime lannister
"Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out.",jon snow
The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton- -,jon snow
House Mormont.,jon snow
We sent raven to Houses Manderly- -,jon snow
The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.,jon snow
Lord Glover.,jon snow
I would remind you that House Glover is pledged to House Stark. Sworn to answer when called upon.,sansa stark
Why did we have to come here?,theon greyjoy
I don't want one.,theon greyjoy
You think Uncle Euron's hunting for us?,theon greyjoy
He'll find us.,theon greyjoy
I don't want any.,theon greyjoy
Some bad years?,theon greyjoy
"If I got justice, my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell.",theon greyjoy
Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.,davos
And that's a good thing?,sansa stark
He was the most experienced commander in Westeros. He chose this place for a reason. Those mountains are a natural fortification. There's a stream down there for the horses.,davos
We're not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day..,jon snow
"Aye, the snows defeated Stannis as much as the Boltons did.",davos
We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.,jon snow
"2,000 Wildlings. 200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins- -",davos
62 Mormonts.,sansa stark
It's not what we'd hoped for. But we still have a chance if we're careful and smart.,davos
For fuck's sake.,davos
So he's your most trusted advisor now? Because he secured 62 men from a ten year old?,sansa stark
Ser Davos is the reason I'm standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.,jon snow
"Stannis who lost the Blackwater, who murdered his own brother, who doesn't have a head?",sansa stark
It's not enough. We need more men.,sansa stark
There's no time.,jon snow
"If we went down to Castle Cerwyn, I know that Lord- -",sansa stark
We fight with the army we have.,jon snow
"Friends, this is not worth fighting over!",davos
"This'll be it, now. Right now, we don't need to be fighting.",davos
Hold on.,davos
You're Westerosi.,arya stark
I want to book passage home.,arya stark
Why do you care?,arya stark
I want a cabin. And we'll leave at dawn.,arya stark
See you at sunrise.,arya stark
You're good at that. Where did you learn?,arya stark
And good at putting holes in them.,arya stark
What happened to the actress? The one who wanted you dead.,arya stark
Mmm.,arya stark
I can't.,arya stark
I don't think I could remember all of the lines.,arya stark
You wouldn't be safe. Not while she's looking for me.,arya stark
She doesn't have a name.,arya stark
Essos is east and Westeros is west. But what's west of Westeros?,arya stark
Nobody does. That's where all the maps stop.,arya stark
I'd like to see that.,arya stark
What's that?,arya stark
I don't want any.,arya stark
I'd call that a successful gambit.,tyrion lannister
Would you?,varys
Look around. The city has come back to life.,tyrion lannister
You made a pact with fanatics.,varys
I did and it worked.,tyrion lannister
"If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you'd say the razor worked. That doesn't mean it won't cut your throat.",varys
Spoken like a man who has never had to shave.,tyrion lannister
I'm going to miss you.,tyrion lannister
I know.,varys
I hope you're right about this expedition of yours.,tyrion lannister
"If I don't return, you'll know I was wrong.",varys
We need friends in Westeros. And we need ships.,varys
"Most of all, we need our queen.",tyrion lannister
She'll come back. She has to. My heart's been broken too many times already.,varys
I'll walk the rest of the way myself. I can't go off on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city.,varys
Varys.,tyrion lannister
The most famous dwarf in the world.,tyrion lannister
Have been permitted? That's rather a tortured way of putting it.,cersei lannister
Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?,cersei lannister
The king is aware of their presence?,cersei lannister
His Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.,cersei lannister
"It is a request, Cousin Lancel. You are asking me for something, I'm refusing.",cersei lannister
He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial.,cersei lannister
Get out.,cersei lannister
I choose violence.,cersei lannister
Please tell His High Holiness he's always welcome to visit.,cersei lannister
"You have a keen military mind, Pod.",brienne
My name is Brienne of Tarth. Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister I've come to speak with him. Tell him I have his sword.,brienne
"Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren't we?",bronn
Podrick fucking Payne. I thought you'd be dead by now.,bronn
Are they in there?,bronn
You think they're fucking?,bronn
"Why not? I'd fuck her. You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?",bronn
"Oh. Well, he'd fuck her, that's for sure. And she's fuck him, don't you think? The way she looks at him. The way all women look at him is frankly irritating. I preferred working with the little brother on that account. Come on, you're the one with the magic cock.",bronn
You must have shown it to her by now.,bronn
Is she? Oh.,bronn
Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?,bronn
"Now, that's the truth, isn't it? You want to learn that sort of fighting?",bronn
"All right, let's start with your footwork.",bronn
Show me your stance.,bronn
"Now, listen to me, Pod. See how your feet are about a yard apart?",bronn
"Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you. ‘Cause they do, Pod. Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire. Do it again. Come on, don't sulk.",bronn
I never thought you'd find her. I just assumed Sansa was dead.,jaime lannister
Why would you assume that?,brienne
"In my experience, girls like her don't live very long.",jaime lannister
I don't think you know many girls like her.,brienne
"Well, I'm proud of you. I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds.",jaime lannister
"Of course my sister wants Sansa dead. The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey's murder, so there is that complication. What the hell are you doing here?",jaime lannister
I've come for the Blackfish.,brienne
You're welcome to have him.,jaime lannister
Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.,brienne
With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?,jaime lannister
The Tully army.,brienne
"They're a bit occupied at the moment. I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels, so you can see the conundrum.",jaime lannister
The Tullys are rebels because they're fighting for their home?,brienne
Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.,jaime lannister
As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.,brienne
Exactly.,jaime lannister
We shouldn't argue about politics.,jaime lannister
"You're a knight, Ser Jaime. I know there is honor in you. I've seen it myself.",brienne
I'm a Lannister. Don't ask me to betray my own house.,jaime lannister
I do no such thing. Take Riverrun without bloodshed. Ride south with your mission complete and your army intact.,brienne
What do you propose?,jaime lannister
Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce. Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.,brienne
Why would he abandon his ancestral home?,jaime lannister
Because you'll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.,brienne
Have you ever met the Blackfish?,jaime lannister
No.,brienne
He's even more stubborn than you are.,jaime lannister
"All right. Try to talk some sense into the old goat. He won't listen, but his men might. Not everybody wants to die for someone else's home.",jaime lannister
"I need your word. If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you'll grant us safe passage north.",brienne
You have my word. You have until nightfall.,jaime lannister
You gave it to me for a purpose. I've achieved that purpose.,brienne
It's yours. It will always be yours.,jaime lannister
"one last thing, Ser Jaime.",brienne
"Yes, Lady Brienne?",jaime lannister
"Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender, and if you attack the castle, honor compels me to fight for Sansa's kin.",brienne
Of course it does.,jaime lannister
To fight you.,brienne
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.,jaime lannister
I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.,brienne
"As I have said, my name is- -",brienne
He always spoke highly of you.,brienne
Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.,brienne
He's not my friend.,brienne
"Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark. He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted. He gave me this sword to protect her. That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die.",brienne
You have more than she does.,brienne
Find the maester. We need to get a raven north to Sansa.,brienne
Tell her I failed.,brienne
There's to be a royal announcement?,cersei lannister
Why wasn't I informed?,cersei lannister
To stand by my son.,cersei lannister
And? Was it just a rumor or something more?,cersei lannister
"I am happy. You should both be as well. Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself.",tyrion lannister
Now it's like a man reborn.,tyrion lannister
Why don't you drink? Why don't either of you ever drink?,tyrion lannister
Why not?,tyrion lannister
And who made these rules? Your former masters?,tyrion lannister
Those miserable old shits didn't want you to be human. Have a drink with me.,tyrion lannister
And you? What's your excuse?,tyrion lannister
That's how you know it's working.,tyrion lannister
Here's to our queen. Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.,tyrion lannister
"To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, long may she reign.",tyrion lannister
Do you like it?,tyrion lannister
"Yes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...I'd like to have my own vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp's Delight. Only my close friends could drink it.",tyrion lannister
"Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.",tyrion lannister
Grey worm?,tyrion lannister
"Right. Three lords walk into a tavern- - a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister. They order ale...",tyrion lannister
"but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, “Spit it out, you see shit. Spit it out.”",tyrion lannister
It's funnier in Westeros.,tyrion lannister
Yes.,tyrion lannister
"A story that's supposed to make you laugh, ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps.",tyrion lannister
"Missandei, do you like the wine?",tyrion lannister
Tell a joke.,tyrion lannister
Ah!,tyrion lannister
You lied to us.,tyrion lannister
I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. The madam says- -,tyrion lannister
Lord Edmure.,jaime lannister
I apologize for the way the Freys treated you. A man of your birth deserved better. You have my word you'll be properly fed and clothes from now on.,jaime lannister
"The Blackfish is an old man. A good death is all he can hope for. But you, you have a child now, I've heard. A son you sired on your wedding night. You're a potent man.",jaime lannister
"You should be with them both. I can arrange that, you realize? Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock. A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride. And when he comes of age, he'll have a keep of his own.",jaime lannister
"I'll remind you that our houses are at war. I'm sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you, but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences.",jaime lannister
Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation? It's not.,jaime lannister
I'll leave the judgments to the gods.,jaime lannister
I was your sister's prisoner once. She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.,jaime lannister
"Perhaps, but she didn't. Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me. But I didn't hate her. I admired her. Far more than her husband or her son.",jaime lannister
"No, I don't, but I'm telling you anyway because you're my prisoner. You don't have a choice. The love she had for her children, I was a little awed by it. Reminded me of my sister.",jaime lannister
I'm not here to trade insults. Your sister was a strong- -,jaime lannister
I'll talk about whomever I want.,jaime lannister
"She loved her children. I suppose all mothers do, but Catelyn and Cersei, there's a fierceness you don't often see.",jaime lannister
They'd do anything to protect their babies.,jaime lannister
Start a war. Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies. The things we do for love.,jaime lannister
"That's exactly why I came here. I love Cersei. You can laugh at that if you want. You can sneer. It doesn't matter. She needs me. And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun. I'll send for your baby boy.",jaime lannister
"And I'll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult. Because you don't matter to me, Lord Edmure. Your son doesn't matter to me. The people in the castle don't matter to me. Only Cersei. And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her, that's what I'll do.",jaime lannister
Come with us.,brienne
Your family is in the North. Come with us. Don't die for pride when you can fight for your blood.,brienne
Good. Bring him to me.,jaime lannister
I was wrong. I admit it.,tyrion lannister
The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead. If the slavers' forces- -,tyrion lannister
And I have acknowledged that. I'm trying- -,tyrion lannister
"All right, what should the army do?",tyrion lannister
And then?,tyrion lannister
Lady Crane?,arya stark
You told her to kill me.,arya stark
A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell and I'm going home.,arya stark
"Despite appearances, I think you'll find the city's on the rise.",tyrion lannister
Perhaps we should take shelter.,tyrion lannister
The city is on the rise?,daenerys targaryen
Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.,tyrion lannister
"Well, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people. But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence. The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters…",tyrion lannister
it proves that no one needs a Master.,tyrion lannister
Good. Shall we begin?,daenerys targaryen
Do we have a plan?,tyrion lannister
"I will crucify the Masters. I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan.",daenerys targaryen
You don't approve?,daenerys targaryen
You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King's Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?,tyrion lannister
"Probably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. That's why Jaime killed him.",tyrion lannister
This is entirely different.,daenerys targaryen
You're talking about destroying cities. It's not entirely different. I'd like to suggest an alternate approach.,tyrion lannister
"We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults.",tyrion lannister
"We obviously didn't communicate clearly. We're here to discuss your surrender, not mine.",daenerys targaryen
My reign has just begun.,daenerys targaryen
Dracarys.,daenerys targaryen
"Thank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven.",tyrion lannister
"It always seems a bit abstract, doesn't it, other people dying?",tyrion lannister
"Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen.",tyrion lannister
You don't have to be here.,jon snow
"Yes, I do.",sansa stark
You're right. There's no need for a battle. Thousands of men don't need to die. Only one of us. Let's end this the old way. You against me.,jon snow
"Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?",jon snow
How do we know you have him?,sansa stark
"You're going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton. Sleep well.",sansa stark
"If he was smart, he'd stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out.",jon snow
"That's not his way. He knows the North is watching. If the other houses sense weakness on his part, they'll stop fearing him. He can't have that. Fear is his power.",davos
"It's his weakness, too. His mean don't want to fight for him. They're forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning...",jon snow
"We're digging trenches all along our flanks. They won't be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment.",jon snow
A pincer move.,jon snow
They won't be able to hit us from the sides.,jon snow
"It's crucial that we let them charge at us. They've got the numbers, we need the patience. If we let him buckle our center, he'll pursue. Then we'll have him surrounded on three sides.",davos
No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.,jon snow
We should all get some sleep.,davos
"So you've met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans.",sansa stark
"Aye, for what they're worth.",jon snow
"You've known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don't know. I lived with him. I know the way his mind works. I know how he likes to hurt people. Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?",sansa stark
You're right.,jon snow
You think he's going to fall into your trap. He won't He's the one who lays traps.,sansa stark
He's overconfident.,jon snow
He plays with people. He's far better at it than you. He's been doing it all his life.,sansa stark
"Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I've defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton.",jon snow
You don't know him.,sansa stark
"All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?",jon snow
"We'll never get him back. Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl. As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won't live long.",sansa stark
We can't give up on our brother.,jon snow
"Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake.",sansa stark
Of course he does. What should I do differently?,jon snow
I don't know! I don't know anything about battles! Just don't do what he wants you to do.,sansa stark
"Aye, that's good advice.",jon snow
You think that's obvious?,sansa stark
"Well, it is a bit obvious.",jon snow
"If you had asked for my advice earlier, I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force, or is that obvious, too?",sansa stark
When will we have a larger force?! We've pleaded with every house that'll have us! The Blackfish can't help us! We're lucky to have this many men!,jon snow
It's not enough!,sansa stark
"Now, it's not enough! It's what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds.",jon snow
"If Ramsay wins, I'm not going back there alive. Do you understand me?",sansa stark
"SNOW I won't ever let him touch you again. I'll protect you, I promise.",jon snow
No one can protect me. No one can protect anyone.,sansa stark
You think there's hope?,davos
It wasn't the Boltons defeated Stannis. It was Stannis himself. I loved the man. He lifted me up and made me something. But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.,davos
What?,davos
"No, it's a manner of speaking. Not actual demons.",davos
"Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings.",davos
"No, he's not.",davos
"No, thanks. It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head. I can never sleep the night before a battle.",davos
I walk. Think and walk. Think and walk until I'm far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.,davos
My lady. You weren't at the war council.,jon snow
Any advice?,jon snow
"If I do, if I fall, don't bring me back.",jon snow
I'm ordering you not to bring me back.,jon snow
You're in my camp. I'm the commander.,jon snow
How do you know what he commands?,jon snow
Why?,jon snow
What kind of god would do something like that?,jon snow
"Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf's height thinks he's the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height. “The height of nobility,” “a man of your stature,” “someone to look up to.” You're all making the same five or six jokes.",tyrion lannister
It was a long time ago.,theon greyjoy
"It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can't imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well.",tyrion lannister
I didn't murder the Stark boys. But I did things that were just as bad or worse.,theon greyjoy
"Doesn't seem like it. He's still alive. It was complicated for you, I'm sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don't we?",tyrion lannister
"You've brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?",daenerys targaryen
Not my claim. Hers.,theon greyjoy
And what's wrong with you?,daenerys targaryen
I'm not fit to rule.,theon greyjoy
We can agree upon that at least.,tyrion lannister
Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?,daenerys targaryen
Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence. He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from yara. He would have murdered us if we had stayed.,theon greyjoy
Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.,daenerys targaryen
We do. And both murdered by a usurper as well.,daenerys targaryen
Will their ships be enough?,daenerys targaryen
"With the former Masters' fleet, possibly. Barely. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet.",tyrion lannister
There are and Euron is building more. He's going to offer them to you.,theon greyjoy
So why shouldn't I wait for him?,daenerys targaryen
The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing. He also wants to give you --,theon greyjoy
And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?,daenerys targaryen
He murdered our father and would have murdered us. He'll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.,theon greyjoy
The Seven Kingdoms.,tyrion lannister
All of them.,theon greyjoy
And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms?,daenerys targaryen
Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands. We ask you to give them back.,theon greyjoy
And that's all?,daenerys targaryen
Reasonable.,daenerys targaryen
What if everyone starts demanding their independence?,tyrion lannister
"She's not demanding, she's asking. The others are free to ask as well. Our father were evil men, all of us here. They left the world worse than they found it. We're not going to do that. We're going to leave the world better than we found it.",daenerys targaryen
"You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms. No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping.",daenerys targaryen
No more.,daenerys targaryen
Prepare to charge! Prepare to charge!,davos
Go! Go! Follow your commander!,davos
We'll just kill our own men. Stand down.,davos
Get word --,jon snow
We may as well be taking shits back here.,davos
Follow!,davos
"With me, lads! Break their line!",davos
We're going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father.,jon snow
Jon.,sansa stark
Where is he?,sansa stark
Your words will disappear. Your house will disappear. Your name will disappear. All memory of you will disappear.,sansa stark
You haven't fed them in seven days. You said it yourself.,sansa stark
They were. Now they're starving.,sansa stark
Confess. Confess.,cersei lannister
Confess.,cersei lannister
"Confess. It felt good. Beating me, starving me, frightening me, humiliating me. You didn't do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother… because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow… and all his little sparrows… all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances.",cersei lannister
You've always been quiet.,cersei lannister
I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died. Do you remember?,cersei lannister
What? Now? Today? You're not going to die today. You're not going to die for quite a while. Ser Gregor.,cersei lannister
"This is Ser Gregor Clegane. He's quiet, too.",cersei lannister
Your gods have forsaken you. This is your god now.,cersei lannister
Shame.,cersei lannister
"You don't even have to do anything, do you?",bronn
"You just sit there, a rich slab of beef, and all the birds come pecking.",bronn
You're welcome to her.,jaime lannister
She doesn't want me. She wants your golden fingers up her twat.,bronn
Those two have their eyes on you.,jaime lannister
"They have their eyes on you, cunt.",bronn
Not my type.,jaime lannister
Not blonde enough?,bronn
"Ladies, have you met Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay.",jaime lannister
There you go.,jaime lannister
Maybe I'm not in the mood.,bronn
Fuck it.,bronn
No need to call me ser just because I'm an anointed knight.,bronn
I'm sure he would be.,jaime lannister
"Have you done much fighting yourself, Lord Frey?",jaime lannister
"No, but back in your day.",jaime lannister
"Yes, you're a great conqueror.",jaime lannister
"They don't fear the Freys, though. They fear the Lannisters. We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands. If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them, why do we need you?",jaime lannister
Show me.,cersei lannister
"He should be with his grandfather, his brother, his sister. Burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood.",cersei lannister
Hello.,sam
From Lord Commander Snow at Castle Black.,sam
I'm-- I'm to be the new maester.,sam
He died.,sam
Maester Aemon became quite ill shortly after the election. He's since passed away. Which is why I'm here.,sam
"Yes, well, I suppose that life is irregular.",sam
"When we had feasts, our family would sit up here… and I'd sit down there.",jon snow
"Aye, you're right. I was luckier than most.",jon snow
What is that?,jon snow
Tell him. Tell him who it belonged to.,davos
Tell him what you did to her. Tell him!,davos
Why?,davos
You burned a little girl alive!,davos
"If he commands you to burn children, your Lord is evil!",davos
I loved that girl like she was my own. She was good. She was kind. And you killed her!,davos
"The only way for what? They all died anyway! You told everyone Stannis was the one. You had him believing it, all of them fooled. And you lied.",davos
"Aye, you were wrong. How many died because you were wrong?",davos
I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder. She admits to the crime.,davos
Do you have anything to say for yourself?,jon snow
"Ride south today. If you return to the North, I'll have you hanged as a murderer.",jon snow
"If you ever come back this way, I will execute you myself.",davos
I'm having the lordo s chamber prepared for you.,jon snow
Mother and Father's room? You should take it.,sansa stark
I'm not a Stark.,jon snow
You are to me.,sansa stark
You're the Lady of Winterfell. You deserve it. We're standing here because of you. The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in. They came because of you. You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.,jon snow
He did.,sansa stark
And you trust him?,jon snow
"Only a fool would trust Littlefinger. I should have told you about him, about the Knights of the Vale. I'm sorry.",sansa stark
We need to trust each other. We can't fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now.,jon snow
Jon.,sansa stark
A raven came from the Citadel. A white raven. Winter is here.,sansa stark
"Well, Father always promised, didn't he?",jon snow
"The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne, he was assassinated. 100 red scorpions, was it?",olenna tyrell
"You murder your own prince, but you expect me to trust you?",olenna tyrell
What is your name again? Barbaro?,olenna tyrell
Obara. You look like an angry little boy. Don't presume to tell me what I need.,olenna tyrell
"Do shut up, dear.",olenna tyrell
Anything from you?,olenna tyrell
No? Good. Let the grown women speak.,olenna tyrell
Cersei stole the future from me. She killed my son. She killed my grandson. She killed my granddaughter. Survival is not what I'm after now.,olenna tyrell
And what is my heart's desire?,olenna tyrell
Fire and blood.,varys
You're not coming with us.,daenerys targaryen
You're not going to Westeros. You're staying here with the Second Sons. There's finally peace in Meereen. You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders.,daenerys targaryen
"You promised me. “My sword is yours. My life is yours.” This is what I command. If I'm going to rule in Westeros, I'll need to make alliances. The best way to make alliances is with marriage.",daenerys targaryen
I don't know. Maybe no one.,daenerys targaryen
I can't bring a lover to Westeros.,daenerys targaryen
So that's what you want? To be my mistress?,daenerys targaryen
I can't.,daenerys targaryen
No one tells me to do anything.,daenerys targaryen
Don't get angry.,daenerys targaryen
"A great number of women, I imagine. Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons.",daenerys targaryen
"We can't call it Slaver's Bay anymore, can we?",daenerys targaryen
"Farewell, Daario Naharis.",daenerys targaryen
How did he take it?,tyrion lannister
No tears.,daenerys targaryen
"I know it was hard for you. You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms. That's the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler, if it's any consolation.",tyrion lannister
It's not.,daenerys targaryen
"No, I suppose not. I'm terrible at consoling.",tyrion lannister
"Yes, you really are.",daenerys targaryen
"All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons. Everything you've ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything. It's all yours for the taking. Are you afraid?",tyrion lannister
Good. You're in the great game now. And the great game's terrifying. The only people who aren't afraid of failure are madmen like your father.,tyrion lannister
Do you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me. A man I thought I cared for. And I felt nothing. Just impatient to get on with it.,daenerys targaryen
He wasn't the first to love you and he won't be the last.,tyrion lannister
"Well, you have completely failed to console me.",daenerys targaryen
"For what it's worth, I've been a cynic for as long as I can remember. Everyone's always asking me to believe in things-- family, gods, kings, myself. It was often tempting until I saw where belief got people. So I said no, thank you to belief. And yet here I am.",tyrion lannister
"I believe in you. It's embarrassing, really. I'd swear you my sword, but I don't actually own a sword.",tyrion lannister
It's your counsel I need.,daenerys targaryen
It's yours. Now and always.,tyrion lannister
"Good. I, um… I had something made for you. I'm not sure if it's right.",daenerys targaryen
"Tyrion Lannister, I name you Hand of the Queen.",daenerys targaryen
My name is Arya Stark. I want you to know that. The last thing you're ever going to see is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.,arya stark
"I'm done with all that. I came here every day when I was a girl. I prayed to be somewhere else. Back then I only ever thought about what I wanted, never about what I had.",sansa stark
I was a stupid girl.,sansa stark
What do you want?,sansa stark
I was wrong.,sansa stark
It's a pretty picture.,sansa stark
"You've declared for other houses before, Lord Baelish. It's never stopped you from serving yourself.",sansa stark
"The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won. My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield.",jon snow
"The war is not over. And I promise you, friend, the true enemy won't wait out the storm. He brings the storm.",jon snow
"There's nothing to forgive, my lord.",jon snow
Come on.,jaime lannister
"When people ask you what happened here, tell them the North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey.",arya stark
"I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass. Dragonglass kills white walkers. It's more valuable to us now than gold. We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it. Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow.",jon snow
Not just the boys.,jon snow
We can't defend the North if only half the population is fighting.,jon snow
"While we're preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses. The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries. I'm not the king of the Free Folk.",jon snow
But if we're going to survive this winter together...,jon snow
Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome. The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.,jon snow
"If they breach the wall, the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold.",jon snow
"The castles committed no crimes. And we need every fortress we have for the war to come. We should give the Last Hearth and Karhold to new families, loyal families who supported us against Ramsay.",sansa stark
The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries. They've kept faith for generation after generation.,jon snow
And then they broke faith.,sansa stark
I'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons.,jon snow
So there's no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty?,sansa stark
The punishment for treason is death. Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle. Harald Karstark died on the field of battle.,jon snow
They died fighting for Ramsay. Give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you.,sansa stark
"When I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch I executed men who betrayed me. I executed men who refused to follow orders. My father always said, ""The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword,"" and I have tried to live by those words. But I will not punish a son for his father's sins, and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is my decision, and my decision is final.",jon snow
Ned Umber.,jon snow
Alys Karstark.,jon snow
"For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield. I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon.",jon snow
Stand.,jon snow
"Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore. The North needs to band together, all the living north. Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always?",jon snow
"You are my sister, but I am king now.",jon snow
Will you start wearing a crown?,sansa stark
"When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me.",jon snow
So I can't question your decisions anymore?,sansa stark
"Of course you can, but--",jon snow
Joffrey never let anyone question his authority. You think he was a good king?,sansa stark
Do you think I'm Joffrey?,jon snow
You're as far from Joffrey as anyone I've ever met.,sansa stark
Thank you.,jon snow
"You're good at this, you know.",sansa stark
At what?,jon snow
At ruling.,sansa stark
No.,jon snow
"You are. You are. They respect you, they really do, but you have to--",sansa stark
Why are you laughing?,sansa stark
"What did father used to say? Everything before the word ""but"" is horse shit.",jon snow
He never said that to me.,sansa stark
"No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls.",jon snow
"Because he was trying to protect us. He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you. Stop trying.",sansa stark
"All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me.",jon snow
I'm not trying to undermine you.,sansa stark
"You have to be smarter than Father. You need to be smarter than Robb. I loved them, I miss them, but they made stupid mistakes, and they both lost their heads for it.",sansa stark
And how should I be smarter? By listening to you?,jon snow
Would that be so terrible?,sansa stark
"Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms--",jon snow
What does she want?,sansa stark
Come to King's Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.,jon snow
"You've been so consumed with the enemy to the north, you've forgotten about the one to the south.",sansa stark
"I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him. And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too.",jon snow
We still have a wall between us and the Night King. Theres nothing between us and Cersei.,sansa stark
There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. They've never ranged this far north.,jon snow
"You're the military man, but I know her. If you're her enemy, she'll never stop until she's destroyed you. Everyone who's ever crossed her, she's found a way to murder.",sansa stark
You almost sound as if you admire her.,jon snow
I learned a great deal from her.,sansa stark
What is this?,jaime lannister
"Its what we've been waiting for our whole lives. It's what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not.",cersei lannister
"He knew it. Made me memorize every damn city, town, lake, forest, and mountain.",jaime lannister
"It's ours now, we just have to take it.",cersei lannister
You've been quiet since you came home. Are you angry with me?,cersei lannister
"No, not angry.",jaime lannister
Are you afraid of me?,cersei lannister
Should I be?,jaime lannister
"Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand. Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her father's throne. Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel. He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada. Where will they land?",cersei lannister
Dragonstone.,jaime lannister
"They have deep-water ports for the ships. Stannis left the castle unoccupied, and that's where she was born.",jaime lannister
Enemies to the east.,cersei lannister
Enemies to the south--Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.,cersei lannister
"Enemies to the west--Olenna, the old cunt. Another traitor.",cersei lannister
Enemies to the north. Ned Stark's bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him. Enemies everywhere. We're surrounded by traitors. You're in command of the Lannister army now. How do we proceed?,cersei lannister
"Winter is here. We can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses. The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock.",jaime lannister
Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?,cersei lannister
"If they think Daenerys will win. No one wants to fight on the losing side. Right now, we look like the losing side.",jaime lannister
I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.,cersei lannister
"Three kingdoms, at best. I'm not sure you understand how much danger we're in.",jaime lannister
I understand we're in a war for survival. I understand whoever loses dies. I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years.,cersei lannister
A dynasty for whom? Our children are dead. We're the last of us.,jaime lannister
"A dynasty for us, then.",cersei lannister
We never talked about Tommen.,jaime lannister
There's nothing to say.,cersei lannister
Our baby boy killed himself.,jaime lannister
"He betrayed me. He betrayed us both. Should we spend our days mourning the dead--mother, father, and all our children?",cersei lannister
Cersei--,jaime lannister
"I loved them. I did. But they're ashes now and we're still flesh and blood. We're the last Lannisters, the last ones who count.",cersei lannister
Even Lannisters can't survive without allies. Where are our allies now? You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family.,jaime lannister
I heard. How could we ever trust a man like that?,cersei lannister
"We couldn't. He was a useless, old coward, but the Freys supported us. Now they're all dead. Whoever killed them is no friend of ours. We need allies. Stronger, better allies. We can't win this war alone.",jaime lannister
You think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing?,cersei lannister
The Greyjoys? You invited the Greyjoys to King's Landing?,jaime lannister
Not all of them.,cersei lannister
"Well, it looks like all of them.",jaime lannister
"I invited Euron Greyjoy, the new King of the Iron Islands. You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies. There you are.",cersei lannister
How are they better allies? How are they different from the Freys? They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them.,jaime lannister
"So does everyone when it suits them. Unlike the Freys, they have ships. And they're good at killing.",cersei lannister
"They're not good at anything. I know the Ironborn. They're bitter, angry little people. All they know how to do is steal things they can't build or grow themselves.",jaime lannister
Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.,cersei lannister
"Oh, what did he come here for, then?",jaime lannister
A queen.,cersei lannister
"You're not a rightful monarch, though, are you?",jaime lannister
"The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated. Come to mention it, weren't you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet? You certainly caught us there. Very smart move on your part. Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway. I was there.",jaime lannister
The people I was cutting down were your own kin.,jaime lannister
And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.,jaime lannister
If not the most humble.,cersei lannister
What do you want in return?,cersei lannister
I decline your proposal.,cersei lannister
You're not trustworthy. You've broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity. You murdered your own brother.,cersei lannister
"Archmaester, I was wondering...",sam
"Um, 147.",sam
I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.,sam
"I asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North, if I could have access to the restricted area of the library.",sam
No.,sam
"Archmaester, with respect, I've seen them--the Army of the Dead. The white walkers. W was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place.",sam
Sources in the restricted area?,sam
"So, you believe me.",sam
That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.,sam
Nope.,brienne
"What do you want, Lord Baelish?",sansa stark
"I am safe. I'm at home, surrounded by friends. I have Brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me.",sansa stark
"At the moment, peace and quiet.",sansa stark
"No need to seize the last word, Lord Baelish. I'll assume it was something clever.",sansa stark
Why is he still here?,brienne
"We need his men. Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton would still hold this castle. Littlefinger saved us.",sansa stark
He wants something.,brienne
I know exactly what he wants.,sansa stark
That's a pretty song. I've never heard it before.,arya stark
I don't want to steal your food.,arya stark
King's Landing.,arya stark
"Not so bad, is it?",arya stark
What are you doing in the Riverlands?,arya stark
"Oh, no, I couldn't. You don't have enough.",arya stark
"You're a long way from home. I'm sure you've had some adventures, though.",arya stark
Boy or girl?,arya stark
Why?,arya stark
It's really good.,arya stark
I'm going to kill the queen.,arya stark
The dead don't.,sam
The Targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons without even knowing what the First Men used it for.,sam
It's a map of Dragonstone. The Targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded Westeros.,sam
"A mountain of it. Beneath the ground. Stannis told me, but I didn't think... This is important. Jon needs to know.",sam
Has she come yet?,jorah mormont
Who?,sam
The Dragon Queen. Daenerys Stormborn.,jorah mormont
Haven't heard anything.,sam
Shall we begin?,daenerys targaryen
"On a night like this, you came into the world.",tyrion lannister
I remember that storm. All the dogs in King's Landing howled through the night.,varys
I wish I could remember it.,daenerys targaryen
I always thought this would be a homecoming. It doesn't feel like home.,daenerys targaryen
We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.,tyrion lannister
Good.,daenerys targaryen
Not so many lions.,daenerys targaryen
"Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms. The lord of Westeros despise her. Even before your arrival, they plotted against her. Now...",varys
They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health?,daenerys targaryen
"People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them.",daenerys targaryen
"If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already.",daenerys targaryen
Conquering Westeros would be easy for you. But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.,tyrion lannister
No.,daenerys targaryen
"We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse. If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won. With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south.",tyrion lannister
I never properly thanked you for that.,daenerys targaryen
"They joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you.",varys
"You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?",daenerys targaryen
I did.,varys
And then you served the man who overthrew him?,daenerys targaryen
"I had a choice, Your Grace--serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe.",varys
But you didn't serve him long. You turned against him.,daenerys targaryen
"Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure. There have been few rulers in history as cruel as the Mad King. Robert was neither mad nor cruel. He simply had no interest in being king.",varys
So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.,daenerys targaryen
"Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who--",tyrion lannister
"Before I came to power, you favored my brother. All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?",daenerys targaryen
"Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace, I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful.",varys
So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.,daenerys targaryen
Which you turned to your advantage.,varys
Who gave the order to kill me?,daenerys targaryen
King Robert.,varys
Who hired the assassins?,daenerys targaryen
Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?,daenerys targaryen
"Your Grace, I did what had to be done to--",varys
To keep yourself alive.,daenerys targaryen
Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.,tyrion lannister
"Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that?",daenerys targaryen
"The kind the realm needs. Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them. I wasn't born into a great house. I came from nothing. I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering. When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie? Not with any king or queen, but with the people. The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule. The people whose hearts you aim to win. If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes. Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me. But if you let me live, I will serve you well. I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you. Because I know the people have no better chance than you.",varys
"Swear this to me, Varys. If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back. You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them.",daenerys targaryen
"I swear it, my queen.",varys
"And I swear this--if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive.",daenerys targaryen
I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.,varys
The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen. You are very welcome here. What is your name?,daenerys targaryen
"She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne. It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?",varys
You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.,daenerys targaryen
We've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king.,daenerys targaryen
"The Lord of Light doesn't have many followers in Westeros, does he?",daenerys targaryen
What does your Lord expect from me?,daenerys targaryen
The prince who was promised will bring the dawn. I'm afraid I'm not a prince.,daenerys targaryen
"Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?",tyrion lannister
"No, but I like it better.",daenerys targaryen
And you believe this prophecy refers to me?,daenerys targaryen
Jon Snow? Ned Stark's bastard?,tyrion lannister
You know him?,daenerys targaryen
I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.,tyrion lannister
"And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is?",varys
He sounds like quite a man.,daenerys targaryen
"I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character.",tyrion lannister
"If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally. The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother. Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do.",tyrion lannister
Very well. Send a raven north. Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone...and bend the knee.,daenerys targaryen
Do you think it's really Tyrion? It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.,sansa stark
Read the last bit.,jon snow
"All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes."" What does that mean?",sansa stark
It's something he said to me the first night we met. You know him better than any of us. What do you think?,jon snow
"Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters. He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk. ""The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne. Join us. Together we can end her tyranny.""",sansa stark
"Sounds like a charmer. Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied and three dragons, a bit less charming.",davos
What?,jon snow
"Fire kills Whites, you told me. What breathes fire?",davos
You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?,sansa stark
"No, too dangerous.",davos
But?,jon snow
"But if the Army of the Dead makes it passed the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?",davos
"If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it. Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell. But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown. With their help the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores. Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts. Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought. This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty.",cersei lannister
"You all remember the Mad King. You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people. His daughter is no different. In Essos her brutality is already legendary. She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay. And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons.",cersei lannister
"It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will but I need your help, My Lords. We must stand together, all of us, if we hope to stop her.",cersei lannister
Lord Tarley.,jaime lannister
"Rickon, isn't it?",jaime lannister
That's it.,jaime lannister
Thank you for coming. The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance now more than ever. They might not have come if you hadn't.,jaime lannister
Do you ride for Hornhill today?,jaime lannister
And what side will you be fighting for? You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle. Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could --,jaime lannister
I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come. I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies. All of her enemies.,jaime lannister
"You swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley.",jaime lannister
"She was a great woman, once. Now she's broken. She wants revenge so badly she brought the Dothraki to our shores. The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history. I know you don't like my sister, but you have to make a choice. Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs?",jaime lannister
When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south. I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley.,jaime lannister
How long?,jorah mormont
But how long 'till...,jorah mormont
Jorah. Jorah Mormont.,jorah mormont
There's no need. I've been dead to them for years.,jorah mormont
"No, I can't say I have. I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room.",cersei lannister
They were his trophies. He couldn't keep them around. They would have made him look small. Sometimes he would come down here and look at them. I believe he brought his whores on occasion.,cersei lannister
"If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms.",tyrion lannister
I know how you wage war. We don't poison little girls here. Myrcella was innocent.,tyrion lannister
That's enough. Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen. You will treat him with respect.,daenerys targaryen
I am not here to be queen of the ashes.,daenerys targaryen
"That's very nice to hear. Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter. The common people loved her, the nobles loved her. And what is left of her now? Ashes. Commoners, nobles, they're all just children really. They won't obey you unless they fear you.",olenna tyrell
"I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council. I'm grateful to all of you. But you have chosen to follow me. I will not attack King's Landing. We will not attack King's Landing.",daenerys targaryen
Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne? By asking nicely?,olenna tyrell
We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides. Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people.,daenerys targaryen
But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.,tyrion lannister
"Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country. If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point. Our army should be Westerosi.",tyrion lannister
You are.,tyrion lannister
Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing.,tyrion lannister
The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army. Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.,tyrion lannister
"So, your master plan is to use our armies? Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?",olenna tyrell
The unsullied will have another objective. For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros. And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock. Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.,tyrion lannister
Do I have your support?,daenerys targaryen
"Thank you all. Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?",daenerys targaryen
I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me. But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros.,daenerys targaryen
"Peace. Do you think that's what we had under your father or his father or his? Peace never lasts, my dear. Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman?",olenna tyrell
"He's a clever man, your Hand. I've known a great many clever men. I've outlived them all. Do you know why? I ignored them. The lords of Westeros are sheep. Are you a sheep? No. You're a dragon. Be a dragon.",olenna tyrell
What are you doing?,jorah mormont
What is it?,jorah mormont
Have you ever done this before?,jorah mormont
"Hello, Hot Pie. Sit down. Who's that for?",arya stark
Mmm. This is good.,arya stark
I didn't do that.,arya stark
One or two.,arya stark
Big lady?,arya stark
She found me.,arya stark
You got any ale?,arya stark
King's Landing.,arya stark
I heard Cersei's queen now.,arya stark
Hmm.,arya stark
Cersei would do that.,arya stark
Why would I go there? The Boltons have it.,arya stark
What?,arya stark
You're lying.,arya stark
Thanks for the pie.,arya stark
Thanks.,arya stark
"Take care of yourself, Hot Pie. Try not to get killed.",arya stark
Come in.,jon snow
This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley. He was my brother at the Night's Watch. A man I trust as much as anyone in this world. He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass.,jon snow
I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone. It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.,jon snow
"He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen. She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister. She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons.",jon snow
Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept.,jon snow
"We need this Dragonglass, My Lords. We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army. We need to mine it and turn it into weapons.",jon snow
"But more importantly, we need allies. The Night King's army grows larger by the day. We can't defeat them on our own. We don't have the numbers. Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire. I need to try and persuade her to fight with us. Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone.",jon snow
Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather? The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive.,sansa stark
I know that.,jon snow
"She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms. The north is one of those seven kingdoms. This isn't an invitation, it's a trap.",sansa stark
"It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that. You know him. He's a good man.",jon snow
"You all crowned me your king. I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home. It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds. But the odds are against us. None of you have seen the Army of the Dead. None of you. We can never hope to defeat them alone. We need allies, powerful allies. I know it's a risk. But I have to take it.",jon snow
Then send an emissary. Don't go yourself.,sansa stark
Daenerys is a queen. Only a king can convince her to help us. It has to be me.,jon snow
You're abandoning your people. Your abandoning your home.,sansa stark
I'm leaving both in good hands.,jon snow
Whose?,sansa stark
"Yours. You are my sister. You are the only Stark in Winterfell. Until I return, the north is yours.",jon snow
I delivered his bones myself. I presented them to Lady Catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister. It seems like a lifetime ago. Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.,petyr baelish
"I was sorry when he died. Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much. So did I. She wasn't fond of you, was she? Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you. Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North. Last best hope against the coming storm.",petyr baelish
You don't belong down here.,jon snow
Forgive me. We have never talked properly. I wanted to remedy that.,petyr baelish
I have nothing to say to you.,jon snow
"Not even thank you? If it weren't for me you'd have been slaughtered at that battlefield. You have many enemies, My King, but I swear to you I'm not one of them. I love Sansa as I loved her mother.",petyr baelish
Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself.,jon snow
Nymeria?,arya stark
"Nymeria, it's me, Arya. I'm heading north, girl, back to Winterfell. I'm finally going home. Come with me.",arya stark
Come with me.,arya stark
That's not you.,arya stark
It's fine.,theon greyjoy
Whatever my queen demands.,theon greyjoy
The bastard of Winterfell.,tyrion lannister
The dwarf of Casterly Rock.,jon snow
I believe we last saw each other on top of the wall.,tyrion lannister
"You were pissing off the edge, if I remember right. You picked up some scars along the road.",jon snow
It's been a long road. But we're both still here.,tyrion lannister
I'm Tyrion Lannister.,tyrion lannister
Davos Seaworth.,davos
and DAVOS shake hands.,tyrion lannister
"Ah, the Onion Knight. We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay.",tyrion lannister
Unluckily for me.,davos
Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor.,tyrion lannister
Of course.,jon snow
Where are you from? I can't place the accent.,davos
Ah. I hear it's beautiful down there. Palm trees and butterflies. I haven't been myself.,davos
This place has changed.,davos
"And Sansa, I hear she's alive and well.",tyrion lannister
She is.,jon snow
Does she miss me terribly?,tyrion lannister
A sham marriage and unconsummated.,tyrion lannister
I didn't ask --,jon snow
"Well, it was. It wasn't. Anyway, she's much smarter than she lets on.",tyrion lannister
She's starting to let on.,jon snow
Good. At some point I want to hear how a Knight's Watch recruit became King in the North.,tyrion lannister
As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.,jon snow
"A long and bloody tale. To be honest, I was drunk for most of it.",tyrion lannister
My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.,jon snow
"Of course they do. If I was your hand I would have advised against it. General rule of thumb, Stark men don't fare well when they travel south.",tyrion lannister
True. But I'm not a Stark.,jon snow
"I'd say you get used to them, but you never really do.",tyrion lannister
Come. Their mother is waiting for you.,tyrion lannister
I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests. You begged us to summon the King in the North. Don't you want to see him again?,varys
Strange. You spoke so highly of Jon Snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff. I didn't take you for a bashful girl.,varys
"Oh, I doubt that. Give us common folk one taste of power we're like the lion who tasted man. Nothing is ever so sweet again.",varys
Why?,varys
So where will you go?,varys
"Good. If you don't mind my saying, I don't think you should return to Westeros. I'm not sure you'd be safe here.",varys
My Lady --,varys
This is Jon Snow.,davos
He's King in the North.,davos
"Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords. I hope the seas weren't too rough.",daenerys targaryen
"The winds were kind, Your Grace.",jon snow
"Apologies. I have a Flea Bottom accent, I know. But Jon Snow is King in the North, Your Grace. He's not a lord.",davos
Forgive me --,daenerys targaryen
"Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth.",tyrion lannister
"Forgive me, Ser Davos. I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen. Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity. But do I have my facts wrong?",daenerys targaryen
"I wasn't there, Your Grace.",davos
"No. Of course not. But still, an oath is an oath. In perpetuity means -- what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?",daenerys targaryen
Forever.,tyrion lannister
"Forever. So I assume, My Lord, that you're here to bend the knee.",daenerys targaryen
I am not.,jon snow
"Oh. Well, that is unfortunate. You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?",daenerys targaryen
Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive. He burned my uncle alive. He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.,jon snow
"My father was an evil man. On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family. And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father. Our two houses were allies for centuries. Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known. Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North. I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow. Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine. Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North. Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it.",daenerys targaryen
You're right. You're not guilty of your father's crime. And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.,jon snow
Then why are you here?,daenerys targaryen
Because I need your help and you need mine.,jon snow
Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?,daenerys targaryen
I did.,jon snow
"And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?",daenerys targaryen
They're hard to miss.,jon snow
"But still, I need your help?",daenerys targaryen
"Not to defeat Cersei. You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall. Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons.",davos
Almost.,tyrion lannister
But you haven't stormed King's Landing. Why not? The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people. It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it. Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.,jon snow
"Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help.",daenerys targaryen
"Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair.",jon snow
You told me you liked this man.,daenerys targaryen
I do.,tyrion lannister
"In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child.",daenerys targaryen
I believe he's calling all of us children. Figure of speech.,tyrion lannister
"Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north.",jon snow
"As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north.",daenerys targaryen
I am not your enemy. The dead are the enemy.,jon snow
The dead?,daenerys targaryen
Is that another figure of speech?,daenerys targaryen
The Army of the Dead is on the march.,jon snow
The Army of the Dead?,tyrion lannister
"You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?",jon snow
"No, I don't think you're either of those things.",tyrion lannister
The Army of the Dead is real. The White Walkers are real. The Knight King is real. I've seen them. If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --,jon snow
we're finished.,jon snow
I was born at Dragonstone. Not that I can remember it.,daenerys targaryen
"We fled before Robert's assassins could find us. Robert was your father's best friend, no? I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib. Not that it matters now of course. I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me. I don't remember all of their names. I have been sold like a brood mare. I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen. The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea. Any sea.",daenerys targaryen
They did for me. I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will.,daenerys targaryen
You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King.,jon snow
The war against my sister has already begun. You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting --,tyrion lannister
whatever you saw beyond the wall.,tyrion lannister
You don't believe him. I understand that. It sounds like nonsense.,davos
"But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North. You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros. He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen. He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He was named King in the North. Not because of his birthright. He has no birthright. He's a damn bastard. All those hard son's of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him.",davos
"All those things you don't believe in, he faced those things. He fought those things for the good of his people. He risked his life for his people. He took a knife in the heart for his people. He gave his own --",davos
If we don't put asside our enmities and band together we will die. And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.,davos
If it doesn't matter you might as well kneel.,tyrion lannister
Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys. Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north.,tyrion lannister
There's no time for that. There's no time for any of this. While we stand here debating --,jon snow
It takes no time to bend the knee. Pledge your sword to her cause.,tyrion lannister
And why would I do that?,jon snow
"I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you. As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name. And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King. The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them. And I will continue to do so as well as I can.",jon snow
"That's fair. It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms. By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion.",daenerys targaryen
You must forgive my manners. You will both be tired after your long journey. We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.,daenerys targaryen
Am I your prisoner?,jon snow
Not yet.,daenerys targaryen
Our Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne.,varys
And?,daenerys targaryen
Two or three ships escaped. The rest sunk our captured. Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured. The Greyjoys are dead or captured.,varys
All of them?,daenerys targaryen
Euron has her.,theon greyjoy
I couldn't save her. I tried.,theon greyjoy
You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown.,cersei lannister
And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.,cersei lannister
You shall have what your heart desires --,cersei lannister
when the war is won.,cersei lannister
"With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country.",cersei lannister
"This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike.",jaime lannister
Advice?,jaime lannister
"I want you to know I understand. Even though we're enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you. I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head. I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking.",cersei lannister
"The sound of your scream. I never heard a sound like that. I thought, that's true love. Oberyn looked beautiful that day. He really did. No one moved like him. No one had such skill with a spear. Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him. If only he hadn't taunted him. He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die. But that wasn't your lover's way, was it? Now he's burried somewhere. And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever. That must be difficult for you. When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child. I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse. I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms. I never got to have a mother. But Myrcella did. She was mine and you took her from me. Why did you do that?",cersei lannister
It doesn't matter now.,cersei lannister
"Your daughter is a beauty too. Brown eyes, those lips. A perfect Dornish beauty.",cersei lannister
I imagine she is your favorite.,cersei lannister
"I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites. But still, we're only human. We love who we love.",cersei lannister
I'm sorry. I can't understand you. The gag makes it difficult to understand what you're saying. It must be frustrating.,cersei lannister
We all make our choices. You chose to murder my daughter. You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.,cersei lannister
"Do you feel powerful now? I don't sleep very well, not at all really. I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies. How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter. I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's. It would be poetic I suppose but fast. Too fast.",cersei lannister
I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.,cersei lannister
"She's so beautiful. The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, it's just not right.",cersei lannister
"Qyburn, he's the cleverest man I know. Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella. The long goodbye, was that it?",cersei lannister
That's the one.,cersei lannister
How long does the poison take?,cersei lannister
But death is certain?,cersei lannister
"Your daughter will die here in this cell. You will be here watching when she does. You will be here the rest of your days. If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat. You will live to watch your daughter rot, to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you've made.",cersei lannister
Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours. I don't want her to miss a thing.,cersei lannister
No.,jaime lannister
Don't.,jaime lannister
What are you doing? No one can see us like this ?,jaime lannister
I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms. I'll do as I please.,cersei lannister
Good. And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.,cersei lannister
The Iron Bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences.,cersei lannister
The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.,cersei lannister
The Iron Bank wants its gold back.,cersei lannister
And we both know gold wins wars. Your vaults are empty. Your late husbando s profligacy saw to that.,cersei lannister
And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.,cersei lannister
That's a fancy way of saying bet. The war has already begun. I've drawn first blood. I decapitated the Dornish snake. My armada owns the Narrow Sea.,cersei lannister
Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.,cersei lannister
"Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think. Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl. You want to invest in her? I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade. How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?",cersei lannister
From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch. In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?,cersei lannister
The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts. Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?,cersei lannister
Give me a fortnight. Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full.,cersei lannister
I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack. You're making it difficult. You look a lot better brooding than I do. You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.,tyrion lannister
I'm a prisoner on this island.,jon snow
"I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island. You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want.",tyrion lannister
Except to my ship. They took my ship.,jon snow
I wouldn't say we took your ship.,tyrion lannister
I'm not playing word games with you. The dead are coming for us all.,jon snow
"Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men.",tyrion lannister
It's hard for me to fathom. It really is. If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --,jon snow
You probably don't believe me.,jon snow
I do actually.,tyrion lannister
You didn't before. Grumpkins and snarks you called them. Do you remember? You said it was all nonsense.,jon snow
"It was all nonsense. Everybody knew it. But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows.",tyrion lannister
How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?,jon snow
Good question.,tyrion lannister
I know it's a good question. I'm looking for an answer.,jon snow
"People's minds aren't made for problems that large. White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister.",tyrion lannister
I need to help prepare my people for what's coming. I can't help them from here. I'd like to leave.,jon snow
It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.,tyrion lannister
"Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes. Don't go south. Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader. And here I am. A northern fool.",jon snow
"Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us. And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye. Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't. Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now. While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter. She protects people from monsters, just as you do. That's why she came here. And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting. That's not a reasonable thing to ask.",tyrion lannister
So do you have anything reasonable to ask?,tyrion lannister
What do you mean?,jon snow
Maybe you are a northern fool. I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.,tyrion lannister
Dragonglass?,daenerys targaryen
"Yes. Volcanic glass, obsidian. He says you have a tremendous amount of it here.",tyrion lannister
Why are we talking about glass? We just lost two of our allies.,daenerys targaryen
"Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally.",tyrion lannister
And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?,daenerys targaryen
"Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them. I'm unsure of the nomenclature.",tyrion lannister
And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?,daenerys targaryen
"I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it.",tyrion lannister
Which wise man said this?,daenerys targaryen
I don't remember.,tyrion lannister
Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?,daenerys targaryen
"I would never do that...to you. The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here. All of his advisors would have told him not to come. I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway. You don't have to believe him. Let him mine the Dragonglass. If he's wrong it's worthless. You didn't even know it was here. It's nothing to you. Give him something by giving him nothing. Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally. Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand. Casterly Rock.",tyrion lannister
What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people? Did you notice that?,daenerys targaryen
You must allow them their flights of fancy. It's dreary in the north.,tyrion lannister
Amazing thing to see.,jon snow
I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon. They're both gone now.,daenerys targaryen
You lost two brothers as well?,daenerys targaryen
People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are. Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.,daenerys targaryen
You've been talking to Tyrion?,jon snow
He is my Hand.,daenerys targaryen
He enjoys talking.,jon snow
We all enjoy what we're good at.,daenerys targaryen
I don't.,jon snow
You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.,daenerys targaryen
I never expected that you would.,jon snow
And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.,daenerys targaryen
I haven't either.,jon snow
I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it. Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.,daenerys targaryen
Thank you.,jon snow
So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?,jon snow
"You better get to work, Jon Snow.",daenerys targaryen
How much do we have?,sansa stark
What does that mean?,sansa stark
What's the longest winter in the past 100 years?,sansa stark
"You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell.",sansa stark
"We must prepare for that eventuality. Every direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be. We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north. If we don't use it by winter's end we'll give it back to them, but if the entire north has to flee to Winterfell there won't be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them.",sansa stark
"Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?",sansa stark
Are they covering those breastplates in leather?,sansa stark
"Well, shouldn't they be once the real cold comes?",sansa stark
Command suits you. The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall.,petyr baelish
So they should be.,sansa stark
I know Cersei better than anyone here. If you turn your back on her --,petyr baelish
You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.,sansa stark
I only meant to say --,petyr baelish
"That the woman who murdered my mother, father and brother is dangerous? Thank you for your wise council.",sansa stark
"One of two things will happen. Either the dead will defeat the living, in which case all our troubles come to an end. Or life will win out. And what then?",petyr baelish
"Don't fight in the north or the south. Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend, every possible series of events is happening all at once. Live that way and nothing will surprise you. Everything that happens will be something that you've seen before.",petyr baelish
I wish Jon was here.,sansa stark
Your father's last living true born son. You're Lord of Winterfell.,sansa stark
I don't know what that means.,sansa stark
"Try, please, for me.",sansa stark
How do you know all of this?,sansa stark
I thought you were the three-eyed raven.,sansa stark
Bran --,sansa stark
"I have to go back inside, Bran.",sansa stark
A bit. Less than before.,jorah mormont
I don't know anything about that. I just started feeling better. I assumed it was the rest that did it.,jorah mormont
And the climate.,jorah mormont
How bad is it?,jorah mormont
I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it. I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could. Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise. The only place for me is with her.,jorah mormont
I owe my life to her and you.,jorah mormont
Perhaps our paths will cross again?,jorah mormont
We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.,daenerys targaryen
"Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet. To send our remaining ships after him --",varys
I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.,daenerys targaryen
But you'll have to go yourself. Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place. You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.,tyrion lannister
"I wouldn't be alone. I'd have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal. What can anyone do to them?",daenerys targaryen
It's too great a risk. You're too important.,tyrion lannister
What about Casterly Rock?,daenerys targaryen
The Unsullied will be there soon.,varys
A difficult situation. They know we're coming.,varys
Yes. Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister. She will be ready.,tyrion lannister
No one has ever taken the rock.,tyrion lannister
"The Lannister army is still the army my father built. Well trained and well provisioned. 10,000 men at least. They will see us coming.",tyrion lannister
They will be ready.,tyrion lannister
The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.,tyrion lannister
The fight up the walls will be hard. We'll be at a disadvantage. Many men will die.,tyrion lannister
"Interesting thing about my father. He built our house up from near ruin. He built our army. He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn't build the sewers. That was beneath him. So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find. Me. He was right. I was low. The company I kept low, women mostly. They weren't welcome at the Rock. Father disapproved of that sort of behavior. I couldn't walk them through the front gates. I couldn't have them in my chambers. So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself.",tyrion lannister
It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.,tyrion lannister
"No better place for low pursuits. Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress.",tyrion lannister
"As a good friend of mine once said, ""give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch.""",tyrion lannister
And so it begins. They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces. They will be outnumbered. They will have less armor and fewer weapons.,tyrion lannister
"But as my sister's armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater. They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them. They will be fighting for you. And that is why they will triump.",tyrion lannister
It's done?,olenna tyrell
It is.,jaime lannister
And now the rains weep for our whores. Did we fight well?,olenna tyrell
I suppose as well as can be expected.,jaime lannister
It was never our forte. Golden roses indeed. Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.,olenna tyrell
"The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore. Well, it is to me. My fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne.",jaime lannister
So you'll just let them take it?,olenna tyrell
"For now. They won't be able to hold it. Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left. Eventually they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros.",jaime lannister
"And you took your army, your real army, and went where they weren't?",olenna tyrell
As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood. There are always lessons in failures.,jaime lannister
Yes. You must be very wise by now.,olenna tyrell
My father always said I was a slow learner.,jaime lannister
"If he was so clever why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry? I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough. No more learning from my mistakes, eh? How will you do it? With that sword?",olenna tyrell
"That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it? Not that he ever used it. What did he call it?",olenna tyrell
Widow's Wail.,jaime lannister
"He really was a cunt, wasn't he? I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders. I never lost a night's sleep over them. They were necessary. And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did. But your sister has done things I wasn't capable of imagining. That was my prize mistake, a failure of imagination. She's a monster, you do know that?",olenna tyrell
"To you, sure. To others as well. But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?",jaime lannister
You love her. You really do love her. You poor fool. She'll be the end of you.,olenna tyrell
"Possibly. Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?",jaime lannister
What better person to discuss it with? What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room? But perhaps you're right. If she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control.,olenna tyrell
"Yes, it has.",jaime lannister
She's a disease. I regret my role in spreading it. You will too.,olenna tyrell
I think we're done here.,jaime lannister
How will it happen?,olenna tyrell
Cersei had several ideas. Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep. Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing. I talked her out of those.,jaime lannister
Will there be pain?,olenna tyrell
No. I made sure of that.,jaime lannister
That's good.,olenna tyrell
"I'd hate to die like your son clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood red, skin purple. It must have been horrible for you as a Kingsguard, as a father. It was horrible enough for me. A shocking scene. Not at all what I intended. You see, I'd never seen the posion work before. Tell Cersei. I want her to know it was me.",olenna tyrell
Halt that wagon!,jaime lannister
opens the carriage. It is filled with gold bars and coins. He picks up a large sack and hands it to BRONN.,jaime lannister
You just won the biggest prize in the world. What could you possibly have to be upset about? Come on. You can tell me. Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?,bronn
I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.,jaime lannister
There is no more High Septon.,bronn
"No, there isn't, is there?",jaime lannister
There is still the question of my prize.,bronn
is putting a padlock on the wagon bearing the gold. He stops and turns to BRONN.,jaime lannister
That's a lot of money I just gave you.,jaime lannister
It's not a castle.,bronn
turns and points to Highgarden.,bronn
How about that one? It's available.,bronn
You don't want Highgarden.,jaime lannister
I beg to differ.,bronn
"We're at war. Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in. Besides, think of the upkeep. The more you own, the more it weighs you down.",jaime lannister
"Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh? All your new riches weighing you down?",bronn
pounds on the back of the carriage and the horses start trotting.,jaime lannister
They're not mine. The gold belongs to the Iron Bank. We pay our debts.,jaime lannister
Right. Just not to me.,bronn
"Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid. When we win this war all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you.",jaime lannister
"Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign will be quiet and peaceful.",bronn
Stranger things have happened.,jaime lannister
Like what?,bronn
The current harvest?,jaime lannister
looks over to BRONN.,jaime lannister
"Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?",jaime lannister
I'm not much for shoveling weight.,bronn
"No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest, I've heard you guys have a real talent for that.",jaime lannister
and TYCHO NESTORIS from the Iron Bank of Braavos are sitting having a discussion.,cersei lannister
"You're too kind, My Lord.",cersei lannister
Is on its way. My brother is supervising its transportation himself.,cersei lannister
We must devise a way to raise their spirits.,cersei lannister
My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.,cersei lannister
"It will indeed. I need to expand my armies, my navies. My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos.",cersei lannister
That's good to hear. I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me.,cersei lannister
This is for you.,petyr baelish
flips the knife in his hand and extends it towards BRAN.,petyr baelish
"The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat, but your mother fought him off.",petyr baelish
"The other dagger, the one that took her life, I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have. I wasn't there for her when she needed me most. But I am here for her now. To do what she would have done, to protect her children. Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask.",petyr baelish
"No. That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings. In a way, that dagger made you what you are today. Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall. I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe.",petyr baelish
hands the sheath of the knife to BRAN. BRAN slides the knife into the sheath.,petyr baelish
"To go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world, I can only imagine --",petyr baelish
"I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark.",petyr baelish
stands up to leave.,petyr baelish
bows and walks past Meera and closes the door.,petyr baelish
approaches the main gate on foot. Two guards are huddled by a brazier getting warm. There's indistinct chatter. One of the men notice ARYA walking to the gate and approach her.,arya stark
In there. I live here.,arya stark
I'm Arya Stark. This is my home.,arya stark
Send for Maester Llewyn or Ser Rodrick. They'll tell you who I am.,arya stark
"Go ask Jon Snow then, the King in the North. He's my brother",arya stark
If Jon Snow is gone who is in charge of Winterfell?,arya stark
Which Lady Stark?,arya stark
Tell Sansa her sister is home.,arya stark
"I'm getting into this castle one way or another. If I'm not who I say I am, I won't last long. But if I am, and Sansa finds out that you turned me away...",arya stark
keeps glancing at the men. They look uneasy. They bring her inside of the gate. They indicate towards a cart near the entrance.,arya stark
is glancing around Winterfell. Men are working building tools and cutting wood. ARYA looks over and sees a Winterfell flag sigil hanging from the wall. The two guards are still arguing.,arya stark
sighs.,sansa stark
You don't have to. I know where she is.,sansa stark
is standing look at a statue of Ned Stark holding his sword. ARYA hears a sound and turns to see SANSA approaching. SANSA stops when she sees ARYA.,arya stark
Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?,arya stark
hesitates for a moment.,sansa stark
Yes.,sansa stark
begins smiling then walking towards ARYA. SANSA reaches out and hugs ARYA.,sansa stark
You shouldn't have run from the guards.,sansa stark
I didn't run. You need better guards.,arya stark
smirks at ARYA.,sansa stark
"It suits you, Lady Stark. Jon left you in charge?",arya stark
"He did. I hope he comes back soon. I remember how happy he was to see me. When he sees you, his heart will probably stop.",sansa stark
That doesn't look like him. It should have been carved by someone who knew his face.,arya stark
Everyone who knew his face is dead.,sansa stark
We're not.,arya stark
turns to face SANSA.,arya stark
They say you killed Joffrey. Did you?,arya stark
I wish I had.,sansa stark
Me too. I was angry when I heard someone else had done it. However long my list got he was always first.,arya stark
Your list?,sansa stark
Of people I'm going to kill.,arya stark
begins to laugh. ARYA joins her.,sansa stark
How did you get back to Winterfell?,sansa stark
It's a long story. I imagine yours is too.,arya stark
Yes. It's not a very pleasant one.,sansa stark
"Mine neither, but our stories aren't over yet.",arya stark
"No, they're not.",sansa stark
"Arya, Bran's home too.",sansa stark
smiles and looks at SANSA. SANSA doesn't smile back. The smile fades from ARYA's face.,arya stark
steps forward and throws her arms around BRAN. SANSA smiles in the background. ARYA lets go and steps back.,arya stark
You saw me?,arya stark
Bran has visions.,sansa stark
So did I.,arya stark
Why would you go back there?,sansa stark
stares at BRAN. ARYA turns to look at SANSA.,arya stark
Who else is on your list?,sansa stark
Most of them are dead already.,arya stark
Where did you get this?,arya stark
"Littlefinger, he's here?",arya stark
turns to look at SANSA.,arya stark
He's declared for House Stark.,sansa stark
steps up closer to BRAN and speaks to him.,sansa stark
Why would he give you a dagger?,sansa stark
Why?,sansa stark
The cutthroat after your fall?,sansa stark
Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?,arya stark
He's not a generous man. He wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back.,sansa stark
What do you mean it doesn't matter?,sansa stark
Are you sure? It's Valyrian steel.,arya stark
looks down at the dagger. She steps forward and takes it from BRAN.,arya stark
is pushing BRAN in his wheelchair and SANSA is next to them. The Stark children are walking back through the gate of Winterfell. Men are milling around doing various jobs. BRIENNE and PODRICK see the Stark children all back at Winterfell together.,arya stark
I did next to nothing.,brienne
I'm not a --,brienne
pauses for a moment.,brienne
"Thank you, Podrick.",brienne
and MISSANDEI are walking along a path outside of Dragonstone followed by members of the Queensguard.,daenerys targaryen
Soon. They will come back to me.,daenerys targaryen
stops and turns to look at MISSANDEI. She then continues walking.,daenerys targaryen
What happened?,daenerys targaryen
Many things?,daenerys targaryen
Your Grace.,jon snow
looks at MISSANDEI then her Queensguard. She speaks in Valyrian and motions to her guard to stand down.,daenerys targaryen
It's all right.,daenerys targaryen
descends the stairs with MISSANDEI and they begin walking with JON. They walk along the beach until they reach a cave. DAVOS is waiting for them with a lit torch.,daenerys targaryen
I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.,jon snow
leads DAENERYS and MISSANDEI into the cave. He lights a brazier and illuminates the Dragonglass along the walls. He continues walking deeper into the cave.,jon snow
"So this is it, all we'll ever need.",jon snow
is looking up at the walls of Dragonglass.,daenerys targaryen
"There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace.",jon snow
and DAENERYS go to a further chamber in the cave. There are murals painted on the walls of Dragonglass.,jon snow
The Children of the Forest made these.,jon snow
When?,daenerys targaryen
A very long time ago.,jon snow
They were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters. Maybe even before there were men.,daenerys targaryen
No.,jon snow
stops looking at the walls and turns to look at JON. JON walks to another wall and begins to examine the murals. The murals depict Children of the Forest and the First Men standing together.,daenerys targaryen
They were here together the Children and the First Men.,jon snow
Doing what? Fighting each other?,daenerys targaryen
takes DAENERYS by the arm and swings her torch to another part of the wall. There is a mural of the Night King and White Walkers.,jon snow
"They fought together against their common enemy. Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together. We need to do the same if we're going to survive.",daenerys targaryen
and DAENERYS look back at the wall with the Night King.,jon snow
Because the enemy is real. It's always been real.,jon snow
turns to look at JON.,daenerys targaryen
And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?,daenerys targaryen
"No, I don't think I can.",jon snow
steps forward closer to JON.,daenerys targaryen
I will fight for you. I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee.,daenerys targaryen
"My people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered.",jon snow
steps even closer to JON until they're face to face.,daenerys targaryen
They will if their king does. They chose you to lead them. They chose you to protect them. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?,daenerys targaryen
"and DAENERYS, DAVOS and MISSANDEI are walking out of the cave. As they exit TYRION and VARYS are standing on the beach awaiting them. DAENERYS begins addressing Tyrion.",jon snow
What is it?,daenerys targaryen
We took Casterly Rock.,tyrion lannister
That's very good to hear.,daenerys targaryen
and VARYS look at each other. They aren't eager to deliver the bad news.,tyrion lannister
Isn't it?,daenerys targaryen
You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves. Perhaps --,davos
You will stay. All my allies are gone. They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.,daenerys targaryen
We still have the largest army.,tyrion lannister
Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.,daenerys targaryen
Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back. We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland. Commit to the blockade of King's Landing. We have a plan. It's still the right plan.,tyrion lannister
"stops walking, turns and speaks harshly to Tyrion.",daenerys targaryen
"The right plan? Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach.",daenerys targaryen
If I've underestimated our enemies --,tyrion lannister
"Our enemies? Your family, you mean. Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all.",daenerys targaryen
begins looking out to the ocean. Three dragons are flying in the sky over the water.,daenerys targaryen
Enough with the clever plans.,daenerys targaryen
turns back and looks at TYRION.,daenerys targaryen
I have three large dragons. I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.,daenerys targaryen
We've discussed this.,tyrion lannister
My enemies are in the Red Keep. What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?,daenerys targaryen
A smart one.,tyrion lannister
looks over to JON SNOW.,daenerys targaryen
What do you think I should do?,daenerys targaryen
I would never presume to --,jon snow
I'm at war. I'm losing.,daenerys targaryen
begins walking close to JON.,daenerys targaryen
looks over the ocean at the dragons flying.,jon snow
I never thought that dragons would exist again. No one did. The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen. Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen. Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.,jon snow
glances back towards the dragons.,jon snow
"But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different. You're just more of the same.",jon snow
looks back out to her dragons flying along the water.,daenerys targaryen
and PODRICK are sparring. BRIENNE kicks PODS foot out from under him and he lands face first in the dirt.,brienne
Don't lunge.,brienne
Don't go where your enemy leads you.,brienne
is watching the sparring session from across the courtyard. She begins to approach Brienne.,arya stark
Up.,brienne
begins striking at PODRICK while he blocks her blows. BRIENNE hits PODRICK in the stomach with the hilt of her sword and PODRICK lands on the ground.,brienne
And don't --,brienne
Don't fight someone like her in the first place.,arya stark
Nice sword. Very nice dagger.,brienne
looks down at the Valyrian dagger and unsheathes it. She approaches BRIENNE flipping the knife several times in her fingers. BRIENNE takes the dagger and examines it.,arya stark
and BAELISH are walking along the upper section of the courtyard having a conversation.,sansa stark
If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with --,sansa stark
sees ARYA in the courtyard speaking with BRIENNE and stops to watch her.,sansa stark
It's been awhile since I've trained.,arya stark
"I can go and find the Master of Arms for you, My Lady.",brienne
He didn't beat the hound. You did. I want to train with you.,arya stark
chuckles.,brienne
"You swore to serve both of my mother's daughters, didn't you?",arya stark
nods her head in agreement.,brienne
"Move aside, Podrick.",brienne
"You can't use that, My Lady. It's too small.",brienne
I won't cut you. Don't worry.,arya stark
smirks and raises her sword to a fighting posture.,brienne
I'll try not to.,brienne
"strikes at ARYA who quickly sidesteps and parries the attack. BRIENNE attacks again and ARYA sidesteps, dodges multiple strikes and parries BRIENNE while smiling. ARYA strikes at BRIENNE and hits her hand causing BRIENNE to flinch and lose her two-handed grip on her sword. BRIENNE regains composure and starts to circle ARYA. BAELISH and SANSA are still watching from the upper balcony. ARYA is waiting for an attack with her sword behind her back. BRIENNE strikes and ARYA blocks her attacks, spins and stabs behind her back and hits BRIENNE in the knee causing BRIENNE's sword to strike the dirt. BRIENNE kicks ARYA in the stomach and sends ARYA to the ground. ARYA quickly gets back to her feet. BRIENNE overpowers ARYA and ARYA drops her sword on the ground. BRIENNE strikes again but ARYA dodges, draws her Valyrian dagger and puts it near BRIENNE's neck. BRIENNE and ARYA both stop fighting and sheathe their weapons smiling.",brienne
Who taught you to do that?,brienne
No one.,arya stark
collects her sword. SANSA walks away. BAELISH remains on the balcony staring at ARYA who looks up at him. BAELISH bows to ARYA and walks away.,arya stark
and DAVOS are walking along the paths outside of Dragonstone having a discussion.,jon snow
What do you think of her?,davos
Who?,jon snow
sighs,davos
I believe you know of whom I speak.,davos
I think she has a good heart.,jon snow
A good heart? I've noticed you starring at that good heart.,davos
"There's no time for that. I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes. How many men do we have in the north to fight him? 10,000? Less?",jon snow
Fewer.,davos
What?,jon snow
and JON near the end of the path. MISSANDEI is standing along the path looking at the ocean.,davos
"Speaking of good hearts, Missandei of Naarth.",davos
"King Snow, isn't it? No? That doesn't sound right. King Jon?",davos
It doesn't matter.,jon snow
Of course.,jon snow
I'm a bastard. My mother and father weren't married.,jon snow
Is the custom different in Naarth?,davos
The sounds liberating.,davos
Why did you leave your homeland?,jon snow
I'm sorry.,jon snow
"If I may, how did a slave girl come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?",davos
"That was good of her. Of course you're serving her now, aren't you?",davos
And if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow --,jon snow
You believe that?,jon snow
You'll forgive me if I switch sides.,davos
notices a single ship sailing into the bay. It has a kraken sigil. MISSANDEI turns to look.,jon snow
Is that a Greyjoy ship?,jon snow
"GREYJOY and other Iron Born are pulling their landing boat onto the beach wading through the surf. They pull the boat onto the sand. JON SNOW, MISSANDEI, DAVOS and Dothraki guards are waiting to meet them. JON sees THEON and both men freeze and stare at each other. JON steps forward towards THEON.",theon greyjoy
Jon. I didn't know you were here.,theon greyjoy
steps closer to JON.,theon greyjoy
"Sansa, is she all right?",theon greyjoy
grabs THEON by his shirt and pulls him face to face.,jon snow
What you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you.,jon snow
releases THEON.,jon snow
We heard your uncle attacked your fleet. We thought you were dead.,davos
I should be.,theon greyjoy
Your sister?,davos
Euron has her. I came to ask the queen to help get her back.,theon greyjoy
The queen is gone.,jon snow
Where did she go?,theon greyjoy
Good.,jaime lannister
We are stretched a bit thin.,jaime lannister
Let's give them fair warning first. These men fought well at Highgarden.,jaime lannister
Rickon.,jaime lannister
openly laughs in DICKON's face and looks at JAIME.,bronn
I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden. Your first battle?,jaime lannister
And?,jaime lannister
Come on. Your father's not here.,bronn
They didn't deserve to die. But Lady Olenna chose to betray the queen and support the Targaryen girl. So here we are.,jaime lannister
Men shit themselves when they die. Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?,bronn
looks over at BRONN,jaime lannister
"Well, I learned it when I was 5.",bronn
pauses and strains to hear a noise far in the distance.,bronn
What?,jaime lannister
Listen.,bronn
Spears and shields! Spears and shields!,jaime lannister
Spears and shields!,jaime lannister
In line now!,bronn
Get back to King's Landing.,bronn
I'm not abandoning my army.,jaime lannister
"You're a commander, not a damned infantryman. These fuckers are about to swamp us.",bronn
We can hold them off.,jaime lannister
Dracarys!,daenerys targaryen
Hold the line!,jaime lannister
Archers! Archers with me!,jaime lannister
Knock!,jaime lannister
Loose!,jaime lannister
Qyburn's scorpion is over there.,jaime lannister
Go get it then.,bronn
I can't shoot with one hand.,jaime lannister
holds up his gold hand to illustrate his point.,jaime lannister
hesitates for a moment. He turns his horse and rides to man the artillery crossbow. JAIME draws his sword and rides into battle.,bronn
Come on!,jaime lannister
Where are you?,bronn
walks to the edge of the battlefield accompanied by Dothraki guards. He can see Lannisters being slaughtered. One of the Dothraki guards begin to speak.,tyrion lannister
is watching the mayhem. Men are screaming and engulfed in flames. Horses and carriages run wild with no driver. JAIME is still on the battlefield struggling against the horde. Burning Lannister men are taking off their helmets revealing melted faces. Men crawl to the river in search of relief from the dragonfire. DROGON and DAENERYS are flying over the river creating wake in the water. JAIME sees her approaching his position.,tyrion lannister
Take cover!,jaime lannister
Come on you fucker.,bronn
commands DROGON to fire at the crossbow.,daenerys targaryen
"Flee, you idiot!",tyrion lannister
looks at DAENERYS and readies himself. He spurs his horse onward.,jaime lannister
"Come on, boy. Come on!",jaime lannister
grabs the spear as he rides by and brings it up to position. JAIME's horse is galloping full speed on the edge of the river kicking up water. TYRION is watching JAIME's attempt to kill DAENERYS.,jaime lannister
You fucking idiot.,tyrion lannister
"is getting close. DAENERYS turns at the last moment to see JAIME bearing down on her spear in hand. DROGON notices JAIME, turns his head and spews flames. BRONN appears from nowhere and manages to dive off of his horse and knock JAIME and himself in the water before they're both consumed by fire. Their horses are instantly burned to death. JAIME is being dragged down by a full set of armor into the dark water. JAIME sinks into blackness and out of sight.",jaime lannister
You could have killed me.,jaime lannister
What the fuck were you doing back there?,bronn
Ending the war by killing her.,jaime lannister
You saw the dragon between you and her?,bronn
looks incredulously at JAIME.,bronn
And?,bronn
sits up and says nothing to BRONN. BRONN sits up and faces JAIME.,jaime lannister
"Listen to me, cunt. Till I get what I'm owed, a dragon doesn't get to kill you. You don't get to kill you. Only I get to kill you.",bronn
"That was only one of them. She has two more. If she decides to use them, to really use them --",jaime lannister
You're fucked.,bronn
Don't you mean we're fucked?,jaime lannister
"No, I do not. Dragons are where our partnership ends. I'm not going to be around when those things start spitting fire on King's Landing.",bronn
I have to tell Cersei.,jaime lannister
pauses and looks at JAIME.,bronn
Best well jump back in that river.,bronn
stands up and walks away. JAIME continues sitting on the shore looking at the smoke and fire from the distant battle.,bronn
is walking over an ash covered ground. There are burned bodies and cargo strewn about. Dothraki are looting dead Lannister soldies. A group of mounted Dothraki are escorting captured Lannister soldiers to where DAENERYS and DROGON are awaiting the prisoners. DAENERYS addresses the captured soldiers.,tyrion lannister
"I know what Cersei has told you, that I've come to destroy your cities --",daenerys targaryen
"burn down your homes, murder you and orphan your children. That's Cersei Lannister, not me. I'm not here to murder. And all I want to destroy is the wheel that is rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world. I offer you a choice. Bend the knee and join me. Together we will leave the world a better place than we found it, or refuse and die.",daenerys targaryen
"Step forward, My Lord.",daenerys targaryen
You will not kneel?,daenerys targaryen
"My sister, she wasn't your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time. So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible.",tyrion lannister
You will not trade your honor for your life. I respect that.,daenerys targaryen
turns to speak to DAENERYS.,tyrion lannister
"Perhaps he could take the black, Your Grace. Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier. He would be invaluable at the Wall.",tyrion lannister
turns to look at her Dothraki escort. The Dothraki walk forward to collect RANDYLL. As the men are pulling RANDYLL away DICKON steps forward.,daenerys targaryen
Who are you?,daenerys targaryen
You are the future of your house. This war has already wiped one great house from the world. Don't let it happen again. Bend the knee.,tyrion lannister
turns to speak to DAENERYS. He speaks softly so no one but the queen can hear.,tyrion lannister
"Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell.",tyrion lannister
I meant what I said. I'm not here to put men in chains. If that becomes an option many will take it. I gave them a choice. They made it.,daenerys targaryen
"Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families --",tyrion lannister
I'm not beheading anyone.,daenerys targaryen
pauses and looks over the DROGON. DRGON roars and shakes his head and flexes his wings.,tyrion lannister
Your Grace --,tyrion lannister
looks to her Dothraki escort and gives a signal. The men grab RANDYLL and DICKON and walk them over to DROGON. RANDYLL takes DICKON by the arm.,daenerys targaryen
"Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die.",daenerys targaryen
pauses a moment and looks at RANDYLL and DICKON.,daenerys targaryen
Dracarys.,daenerys targaryen
"is quickly walking down the hall leading to CERSEI's room. As he approaches, QYBURN exits the queen's chambers.",jaime lannister
passes by QYBURN without saying a word and barges into CERSEI's quarters. CERSEI stand and walks over to JAIME.,jaime lannister
How many men did we lose?,cersei lannister
We haven't done a full counting.,jaime lannister
"It's armies that win wars. We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us. We can buy mercenaries.",cersei lannister
shakes his head.,jaime lannister
"They're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be.",cersei lannister
"I just saw the Dothraki fight. They'll beat any mercenary army. They'll beat any army I've ever seen. Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport. Her dragon burned a thousand wagons. Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you. They couldn't stop it. And she has three of them. This isn't a war we can win.",jaime lannister
"So what do we do? Sue for peace? I sit on her father's throne, the father you betrayed and murdered. And in her mind she's winning. What sort of offer do you think she'd make?",cersei lannister
turns and walks away from JAIME.,cersei lannister
Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son.,cersei lannister
He didn't.,jaime lannister
"You saw the crossbow, you saw his body.",cersei lannister
walks across the room to where CERSEI is standing.,jaime lannister
I'm not talking about father. Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey. He had nothing to do with it.,jaime lannister
After all this time it still amazes me --,cersei lannister
It was Olenna. She confessed before she died.,jaime lannister
And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?,cersei lannister
After.,jaime lannister
And you believed her?,cersei lannister
If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen? Which one would Margerey been better able to control? Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms? She was telling the truth.,jaime lannister
"looks away, then sits down.",cersei lannister
I shouldn't have listened to you. She should have died screaming.,cersei lannister
"She's dead like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house. And if we don't find a way out of this war we'll follow them.",jaime lannister
So we fight and die or we submit and die. I know my choice. A soldier should know his.,cersei lannister
SNOW is standing on the edge of a cliff looking towards the ocean. DROGON roars and flies over him with DAENERYS on his back. DROGON lands next to JON and charges towards him. DROGON opens his jaws and roars in JON's face. DROGON creeps closer until he is inches from JON. JON removes his glove and slowly extends his hand toward DROGON. DROGON lowers his head and allows JON to touch him. DAENERYS looks surprised and steps down from her mount. DROGON turns and flies away.,jon snow
"They're beautiful, aren't they?",daenerys targaryen
"That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are. Gorgeous beasts.",jon snow
"They're not beasts to me. No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, they're my children.",daenerys targaryen
turns to look at her three dragons as they fly over Dragonstone in the distance.,daenerys targaryen
You weren't gone long.,jon snow
turns back to JON.,daenerys targaryen
No.,daenerys targaryen
And?,jon snow
And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.,daenerys targaryen
pauses and doesn't say anything.,jon snow
You're not sure how you feel about that?,daenerys targaryen
"No, I'm not.",jon snow
"turns and starts walking towards the castle, JON follows.",daenerys targaryen
How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?,daenerys targaryen
Thousands.,jon snow
We both want to help people. We can only help them from a position of strength. Sometimes strength is terrible. When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.,daenerys targaryen
Ser Davos gets carried away.,jon snow
So it was a figure of speech?,daenerys targaryen
doesn't say anything. A group of Dothraki guards approach DAENERYS and speak in their native tongue.,jon snow
He is my friend.,daenerys targaryen
kneels before DAENERYS.,jorah mormont
Your Grace.,jorah mormont
stands.,jorah mormont
"Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend.",daenerys targaryen
I served with your father. He was a great man.,jon snow
nods to JON.,jorah mormont
You look strong. You found a cure?,daenerys targaryen
"I wouldn't be here if I hadn't. I return to your service, my queen, if you'll have me.",jorah mormont
It would be my honor.,daenerys targaryen
steps forward and hugs JORAH.,daenerys targaryen
stops working and turns around.,sam
turns to collect his work and leave. The maesters begin talking to one another.,sam
and TYRION are sitting on the stairs of the Throne Room alone. VARYS has a sealed raven scroll in his hand tapping it on the stone. TYRION is drinking a glass of wine having a discussion with VARYS.,varys
All rulers demand that people bend the knee. It's why they're rulers. She gave Tarley a choice. A man who had taken up arms against her. What else could she do?,tyrion lannister
Not burn him alive alongside his son.,varys
"I am her hand, not her head. I can't make her decisions for her.",tyrion lannister
That's what I used to tell myself about her father. I found the traitors but I wasn't the one burning them alive. I was only a purveyor of information.,varys
"reaches over to TYRION's cup of wine, picks it up and begins to drink from it. He grimaces as he drinks.",varys
"It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy, ""I'm not the one doing it."" As the pitch of their screams rose higher, ""I'm not the one doing it."" When their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the Thone Room, ""I'm not the one doing it.""",varys
drinks again and sets the cup down next to TYRION. TYRION picks it up.,varys
Daenerys is not her father.,tyrion lannister
And she never will be... with the right counsel. You need to find a way to make her listen.,varys
looks down at the note in VARYS's hand.,tyrion lannister
Who is that for?,tyrion lannister
Jon Snow.,varys
Did you read it?,tyrion lannister
It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.,varys
pauses and drinks from his cup of wine.,tyrion lannister
What's it say?,tyrion lannister
Nothing good.,varys
and VARYS are seated at the painted table. TYRION and JORAH stand near the queen. DAVOS and JON SNOW are standing on the other end of the table. JON is holding a raven scroll and reading it.,daenerys targaryen
I thought Arya was dead. I thought Bran was dead.,jon snow
I'm happy for you. You don't look happy.,daenerys targaryen
Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch. If they make it past the wall --,jon snow
The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years. Presumably --,varys
interrupts VARYS.,jon snow
I need to go home.,jon snow
You said you don't have enough men.,daenerys targaryen
We'll fight with the men we have. Unless you'll join us.,jon snow
And give the country to Cersei? As soon as I march away she marches in.,daenerys targaryen
Perhaps not. Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children. What if we prove her wrong?,tyrion lannister
I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.,jon snow
begins walking around the table closer to JON.,tyrion lannister
So bring the dead to her.,tyrion lannister
I thought that was what we are trying to avoid.,daenerys targaryen
We don't have to bring the whole army. Only one soldier.,tyrion lannister
Is that possible?,davos
The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.,jon snow
Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.,tyrion lannister
Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital.,varys
The only person she listens to is Jaime. He may listen to me.,tyrion lannister
And how would you get into King's Landing.,daenerys targaryen
"I can smuggle you in, but if the Goldcloaks were to recognize you, I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter.",davos
nods his head.,tyrion lannister
"Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men.",daenerys targaryen
Fair point. How do you propose to find one?,varys
pauses and stares at the ground. JORAH breaks the silence.,jon snow
With the queen's permission I'll go north and take one.,jorah mormont
turns to look at JORAH.,daenerys targaryen
You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you. Allow me to serve you.,jorah mormont
The free folk will help us. They know the real north better than anyone.,jon snow
They won't follow Ser Jorah.,davos
They won't have to.,jon snow
You can't lead a raid beyond the wall. You're not in the Night's Watch anymore. You're King in the North.,davos
I'm the only one here whose fought them. I'm the only one here who knows them.,jon snow
I haven't given you permission to leave.,daenerys targaryen
"With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission. I am a king. And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive. I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people. Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance.",jon snow
pauses for a moment then nods her head in agreement.,daenerys targaryen
"You're very kind, my lords, but Jon is our king. He is doing what he thinks is best.",sansa stark
and ARYA are walking through the hall to SANSA's quarters having a discussion.,sansa stark
I warned Jon this would happen. He can't leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.,sansa stark
He didn't. He trusted you to hold it for him.,arya stark
"Well, he's not making it easy. The northern lords are proud.",sansa stark
These are mother and father's chambers.,arya stark
And?,sansa stark
Nothing.,arya stark
Don't do that.,sansa stark
turns around to face ARYA.,sansa stark
What?,arya stark
Say what you mean.,sansa stark
You always liked nice things. It made you feel better than everyone.,arya stark
drops the papers in her hand on a table and looks at ARYA.,sansa stark
Are you angry with me?,sansa stark
They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened.,arya stark
"I listened to their complaints, which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell.",sansa stark
Their opinions are important to you?,arya stark
"Glover has 500 men. Royce has 2,000. Offend them and Jon loses his army.",sansa stark
Not if they lose their heads first.,arya stark
"Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands. We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale, all of us working together. Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but that's not the way you get people to work together.",sansa stark
"And if Jon doesn't come back, you'll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want.",arya stark
How can you even think such a horrible thing?,sansa stark
"You're thinking it right now. You don't want to be, but the thought just won't go away.",arya stark
and ARYA stare at each in silence for a moment.,sansa stark
I have work to do.,sansa stark
turns and walks away from ARYA.,sansa stark
My lady.,arya stark
exits the room.,arya stark
and TYRION are standing on the beach of King's Landing. DAVOS is securing a small row boat. TYRION is looking up towards the city walls.,davos
Last time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow.,tyrion lannister
Last time I was here you killed my son with wildfire.,davos
turns to look at DAVOS. DAVOS walks next to TYRION and stakes the boat anchor into the sand.,tyrion lannister
There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff. The guards hardly ever patrol it. Too many steps.,davos
begins walking towards the path. DAVOS follows him and quickly takes the lead. TYRION stops and looks back towards the unattended boat.,tyrion lannister
You're not staying here?,tyrion lannister
I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.,davos
What if someone takes the boat?,tyrion lannister
Then we're fucked. Best hurry.,davos
and JAIME are walking by the dragon skulls. Both men have sparring swords in their hand.,bronn
We don't have time for this. We should be preparing the city for a siege. The Dothraki are coming.,jaime lannister
All the more reason for you to train. Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12 year olds.,bronn
I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.,jaime lannister
And here I am ready to train.,bronn
Why down here?,jaime lannister
I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.,bronn
Today might be the day I kill you by accident.,jaime lannister
"Oh, you won't be swinging it at me.",bronn
stops walking and holds his torch out. TYRION steps from around a pillar and looks at JAIME. JAIME looks angrily at BRONN.,bronn
I'll leave you to it.,bronn
turns and walks away leaving JAIME and TYRION alone.,bronn
I needed to see you and I knew you'd never agree to meet.,tyrion lannister
remains silent and stares at TYRION.,jaime lannister
"You made me look like a complete fool. I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me. You abandoned the family home. Completely unsentimental. Father would have been proud.",tyrion lannister
Don't talk about our father.,jaime lannister
Listen to me --,tyrion lannister
I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again I'd cut you in half.,jaime lannister
glances down at the sword in JAIME's hand.,tyrion lannister
It would take you awhile with a sparring sword.,tyrion lannister
shakes his head and says nothing.,jaime lannister
"He was going to execute me. He knew I was innocent. He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am. The little monster sent to punish him. Do you think I wanted to be born this way? Did he think I chose --",tyrion lannister
What do you want?,jaime lannister
Daenerys will win this war. You're a military man. You must know there is no way around it. Daenerys is not her father. She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.,tyrion lannister
You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself.,jaime lannister
I -- I don't. Daenerys doesn't. Not right now anyway. She has a more important request.,tyrion lannister
I wasn't sure I'd find you.,davos
I thought you might still be rowing.,davos
"I looked in shops, taverns, brothels. I should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel.",davos
I haven't been here in years. Why should they recognize me? Sometimes I hardly do. Nothing fucks you harder than time.,davos
"walks to the side of the shop and inspects a rack of swords. He pulls one, nods in approval and puts it back in its place. He turns back to GENDRY.",davos
Anybody give you any trouble?,davos
Don't be so sure. Safety is never a permanent state of affairs. Bad things are coming.,davos
I think you need to understand --,davos
You should know what you're heading into.,davos
You might want to bring one of those swords.,davos
and GENDRY are walking towards the boat DAVOS left on the beach.,davos
Keep your father's name to yourself. The situation is complicated enough already.,davos
turns and notices the two guards approaching the boat. He turns and loudly addresses GENDRY.,davos
"I told you, Clovis, if we don't get out of here soon someone is going to --",davos
"No weapons, friends. I promise. What can I do for you?",davos
It is.,davos
Still five gold dragons?,davos
15?,davos
angrily reaches into his pouch and pays the men.,davos
I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.,davos
turns and begins walking back to his boat.,davos
pauses and turns back to the guards.,davos
Not more gold.,davos
Come and have a look.,davos
Fermented crab.,davos
"Fermented crab. One bucket of this triples the brothel's earnings for the week. A man thinks he's done, he's ready to go back to his loving family, but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth. Five minutes later, he's back in the race. Here, have a taste.",davos
scoops up a bit of fermented crab and offers it to the guards. Both men reach out and take a pinch. The guards sniff the crab and put it in their mouth. They both recoil from the taste and look at each other.,davos
I'd hurry to your favorite establishment or you'll put a whole in that chainmail.,davos
quickly walks to cut the guards off.,davos
I really wouldn't try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you.,davos
Fish hook. Some men you just can't teach.,tyrion lannister
is still standing behind the guards. He retrieves his gold pouch again and holds it up shaking it.,davos
Perhaps there's some arrangement?,davos
is looking at TYRION and motions towards GENDRY.,davos
This is Gendry.,davos
He'll do.,tyrion lannister
opens the door and step into the queen's room. CERSEI is seated near a window speaking to QYBURN.,jaime lannister
That won't be necessary.,cersei lannister
Why was QYBURN here?,jaime lannister
He's Hand of the Queen. Why are you here?,cersei lannister
I met with Tyrion.,jaime lannister
pauses for a moment making JAIME uncomfortable.,cersei lannister
What did our brother have to say?,cersei lannister
Daenerys wants to meet.,jaime lannister
To discuss a surrender?,cersei lannister
To discuss an armistice.,jaime lannister
She just won a great victory. Why would she want a truce now?,cersei lannister
Because an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms. Tyrion claims he'll have proof.,jaime lannister
smirks and looks away from JAIME.,cersei lannister
Are you going to punish him?,cersei lannister
Tyrion?,jaime lannister
Bronn.,cersei lannister
looks confused.,jaime lannister
He betrayed you. He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent. Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing?,cersei lannister
You let it happen. Why?,jaime lannister
"I've come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest. She has the numbers. If we want to beat her we have to be clever. We have to fight her like father would have. Dead men, dragons and Dragon Queens, whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house. For this.",cersei lannister
lifts her hands from the chair and places them both on her stomach indicating she's pregnant. JAIME looks shocked.,cersei lannister
Who will you say is the father?,jaime lannister
You.,cersei lannister
People won't like that.,jaime lannister
stands from her chair and walks in front of JAIME.,cersei lannister
Do you remember what father used to say about people?,cersei lannister
The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.,jaime lannister
reaches forward and takes CERSEI and kisses her. While they embrace CERSEI speaks to JAIME.,jaime lannister
Never betray me again.,cersei lannister
We're leaving today. The king's got a lot on his mind.,davos
He doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king.,davos
"You're just Clovis, a smith who's come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges.",davos
and GENDRY enter the mouth of the cave. JON is walking along the corridor.,davos
"Begging your pardon, Your Grace.",davos
stops and turns around to face DAVOS.,jon snow
You survived King's Landing.,jon snow
Yet again.,davos
"Your Grace, this is --",jon snow
looks to DAVOS.,jon snow
He was meant to keep that to himself.,davos
I saw your father once at Winterfell.,jon snow
You're a lot leaner.,jon snow
stops smiling and pauses a moment. Then he chuckles.,jon snow
I grew up on stories about them.,jon snow
Don't be a fool. You're not a soldier.,davos
Do you know how to use one?,jon snow
"Well, that's a problem.",jon snow
He can handle himself.,davos
nods.,jon snow
We could use the help.,jon snow
"As my father used to say, it's better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life.",davos
Yeah. Nobody mind me. All I've ever done is live to a ripe old age.,davos
"You may not believe it, but I've missed you Mormont. Nobody glowers quite like you. Not even Grey Worm.",tyrion lannister
retrieves a gold coin from his pocket and turns it in his hands.,tyrion lannister
This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us. Remember?,tyrion lannister
It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.,jorah mormont
smiles and hands the coin to JORAH.,tyrion lannister
Take it with you. You'll bring it back. Our queen needs you.,tyrion lannister
nods to TYRION. DAENERYS appears and walks up to JORAH.,jorah mormont
We should be better at saying farewell by now.,daenerys targaryen
"Your Grace, I --",jorah mormont
"reaches forward and takes JORAH by his hands. JON SNOW, DAVOS and GENDRY exit the cave and walk towards the boats. JORAH bends and kisses DAENERY's hand. He turns and continues readying the boat. JON stands in front of DAENERYS.",daenerys targaryen
If I don't return at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore.,jon snow
smiles.,daenerys targaryen
But I've grown used to him.,daenerys targaryen
"I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace.",jon snow
nods to JON. JON turns and walks to the head of the boat. The men take hold of it.,daenerys targaryen
Heave!,jon snow
is seated at a table surround by papers and candles. He is writing notes into a book. Gilly is seated across from him reading aloud from a tome. SAM JR. is playing on the bed.,sam
No.,sam
looks up from his work annoyed. He remains silent and continues working.,sam
"is walking through a dark library. He heads to the restricted section and unlocks the barred gate. He begins removing books and scrolls from shelfs and stuff them in his satchel. After retrieving what he needs, SAM quickly walks to the exit of the library. He pauses before he leaves and turns around. He glances back at the library. It is many stories tall lined with countless shelves of books. SAMWELL looks at the library one last time, turns and walks out of the door.",sam
is in the kennels observing PETER BAELISH and a Winterfell servant having a conversation. The servent is whispering in BAELISH's ear. ARYA can't hear the conversation. ARYA sees BAELISH hand the servant a raven scroll. The servant turns to leave. BAELISH senses someone is watching him and he looks to where ARYA stood but she has already vanished. BAELISH turns and leaves the kennels.,arya stark
is on the upper level looking down at BAELISH. He is having a conversation with ROBETT GLOVER and YOHN ROYCE. She can't hear what's being said. BAELISH finishes his conversation and walks away from the men. ARYA disappears behind the corner and continues following BAELISH.,arya stark
"is walking down the hallway. She pauses, peers around a corner and looks towards the door of BAELISH's quarters. BAELISH appears and unlocks his door. Before he walks in MAESTER WOLKAN approaches him. She continues watching the men.",arya stark
reads the note then looks at WOLKAN.,petyr baelish
Are you sure this is the only copy at Winterfell?,petyr baelish
Lady Stark thanks you for your service.,petyr baelish
and the raiding party land on the Beach of Eastwatch. JON looks up at the castle. The men collect their equipment and make for the castle.,jon snow
I've been failing at that job of late.,davos
Two.,jon snow
Both.,jon snow
looks around the table.,jon snow
Not enough.,jon snow
smiles and shakes his head. TORMUND is disappointed.,jon snow
We were hoping some of your men could help.,jorah mormont
I'll be staying behind. I'm a liability out there as you well know.,davos
You're The Hound. I saw you once at Winterfell.,jon snow
Thoros?,jorah mormont
I hardly recognized you.,jorah mormont
He was my father.,jorah mormont
"You returned the favor, as I recall.",jorah mormont
Our reasons aren't your reasons.,davos
Don't you want to know what we're doing?,jorah mormont
He's right. We're all on the same side.,jon snow
We're all breathing.,jon snow
Are you all right?,jon snow
Ever been north before?,jon snow
You've never been down south.,jon snow
That's the north.,jon snow
There's not another woman within 100 miles of here.,jon snow
glances at GENDRY. GENDRY backs away from JON and TORMUND.,jon snow
Davos says he is a strong fighter.,jon snow
She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.,jon snow
The first time I went north of the wall was with your father.,jon snow
He was a good man. He deserved a better son. Were you with him at the end?,jorah mormont
I was a prisoner of the Wildlings. But we avenged him. I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.,jon snow
"I can't think of a worse way for him to go. The Night's Watch was his life. He would have died to protect every one of those men, and they butchered him.",jorah mormont
I hate that he died that way. My father was the most honorable man I ever met. He was good all the way through. And he died on the executioner's block.,jon snow
Your father wanted to execute me.,jorah mormont
I heard.,jon snow
He was in the right of course. It didn't make me hate him any less.,jorah mormont
and JON glance at each other.,jorah mormont
I'm glad he didn't capture you.,jon snow
Me too.,jorah mormont
stops walking and loosens the belt holding his sword.,jon snow
"Your father gave me this sword. He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw.",jon snow
hands the sword to JORAH. JORAH slowly takes the sword and looks it over in his hands.,jon snow
Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.,jon snow
stops examining the sword and looks up to JON.,jorah mormont
But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries. It's not right for me to have it.,jon snow
"pauses, then nods at JON.",jorah mormont
He gave it to you.,jorah mormont
I'm not his son.,jon snow
"pulls the sword halfway out of the sheath and inspects the blade, turning it in his hands.",jorah mormont
I brought shame to my house. I broke my father's heart.,jorah mormont
resheaths the blade and hands it back to JON.,jorah mormont
I forfeited the right to claim this sword. It's yours. May it serve you well and your children after you.,jorah mormont
Father used to watch us from up here. He wouldn't say much. You probably don't remember. You were inside knitting all the time.,arya stark
I remember.,sansa stark
"One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick. I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground. Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw. There was one arrow in the target. There was no one around, just like now. No one to stop me. So I started shooting. And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again. I wasn't very good. Finally I hit the bullseye. It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th. I don't remember. But I hit the bullseye and I heard this.",arya stark
starts a slow clap.,arya stark
I looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me. I knew what I was doing was against the rules. But he was smiling so I knew it wasn't wrong. The rules were wrong. I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it. Now he's dead. Killed by the Lannisters with your help.,arya stark
turns to look at ARYA.,sansa stark
What?,sansa stark
retrieves a raven scroll from her pocket and unrolls it.,arya stark
"That's your pretty handwriting. Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles because I couldn't write as well as you. ""Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart. Our good King Robert is dead. Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt --",arya stark
You don't have to read it. I remember.,sansa stark
"Father has been charged with treason. He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne. The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort. I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark. Your faithful sister, Sansa.",arya stark
They forced me to do it.,sansa stark
Did they. With a knife at your throat? Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?,arya stark
You don't know what it was like. I was a child.,sansa stark
So was I. I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.,arya stark
They told me it was the only way to save father.,sansa stark
And you were stupid enough to believe them. I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block. I remember the pretty dress you were wearing. I remember the fancy way you did your hair.,arya stark
You were there?,sansa stark
I was there standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.,arya stark
And what did you do? Did you come running to the rescue? Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father?,sansa stark
I wanted to.,arya stark
But you didn't. Just like me.,sansa stark
I didn't betray him. I didn't betray Robb. I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.,arya stark
"You should be on your knees thanking me. We're standing in Winterfell again because of me. You didn't win it back. Jon didn't win it back. He lost the Battle of the Bastards. The Knight's of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where, traveling the world?",sansa stark
I was training.,arya stark
"Training. Well, while you were training I suffered things you can never imagine.",sansa stark
"Oh, I don't know about that. I can imagine quite a lot.",arya stark
You never would have survived what I survived.,sansa stark
I guess we'll never know.,arya stark
What are you doing to do with that letter.,sansa stark
I don't know yet.,arya stark
Who did you show it to? Where did you find it?,sansa stark
"You're scared, aren't you? What are you scared of? You didn't commit any crimes. No one's going to hang you.",arya stark
Arya --,sansa stark
Are you scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry? No. That's not Jon. He'll understand. You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.,arya stark
"Do you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting? This is exactly what she wants. This is what she's always wanted, to tear us apart --",sansa stark
"The northern lords will read it. They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding. What would little Lyanna Mormont say? She's younger than you were when you wrote this. Are you going to say, ""But I was just a child""?",arya stark
You're angry. Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.,sansa stark
Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things. I'll go with anger.,arya stark
turns and walks away.,arya stark
Who's that?,jon snow
You knew him?,jon snow
I serve the north.,jon snow
The lord of light never spoke to me. I don't know anything about him. I don't know what he wants from me.,jon snow
Why?,jon snow
"That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know. So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants.",jon snow
So what are you fighting for?,jon snow
But we all die.,jon snow
I am the shield that guards the realms of men.,jon snow
Aye. Maybe that's enough.,jon snow
is sitting in a chair staring into the fire. DAENERYS stands across the room next to the painted table.,tyrion lannister
Do you know what I like about you?,daenerys targaryen
turns to look at DAENERYS.,tyrion lannister
I honestly don't.,tyrion lannister
You're not a hero.,daenerys targaryen
Oh. I've been heroic on occasion.,tyrion lannister
walks over to the fire and sits in the chair opposite from TYRION.,daenerys targaryen
I once charged through the mud gate of King's Landing.,tyrion lannister
"I don't want you to be a hero. Heroes do stupid things and they die. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing.",daenerys targaryen
"It's interesting these heroes you name. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you.",tyrion lannister
Jon Snow's not in love with me.,daenerys targaryen
"Oh, my mistake. I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance.",tyrion lannister
Oil?,bronn
How many barrels?,bronn
Get 500 more.,bronn
"I still enjoy it when they call me ""my lord.""",bronn
The thrill will fade.,jaime lannister
If we live that long. Men without cocks. You wouldn't find me fighting in an army if I had no cock. What's left to fight for?,bronn
Gold?,jaime lannister
I spent my life around soldiers. What do you think they spend that gold on?,bronn
Family.,jaime lannister
"Not without a cock, you don't.",bronn
Maybe it really is all cocks in the end.,jaime lannister
"Yet, your brother--",bronn
"Yes, he's always been a champion of the downtrodden.",jaime lannister
I think we're about to be the downtrodden.,bronn
How many people live here?,jon snow
"A million, give or take.",tyrion lannister
That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way?,jon snow
There's more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior.,tyrion lannister
Why isn't she with them?,cersei lannister
And the rest of them?,cersei lannister
Including our brother.,cersei lannister
"If anything goes wrong, kill the silver-haired bitch first, then our brother, then the bastard who calls himself king.",cersei lannister
"Dragons don't understand the difference between what is theirs and what isn't. Land, livestock, children... Letting them roam free around a city was a problem.",jorah mormont
"I imagine it was a sad joke at the end. An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs. But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world.",tyrion lannister
Maybe it still is.,davos
"Welcome, my lords. Your friends arrived before you did.",bronn
I've been sent to escort you all to the meeting.,bronn
A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation.,tyrion lannister
"Supporting the enemy, no less.",tyrion lannister
Cersei will anyway.,tyrion lannister
Come on! You can suck his magic cock later.,bronn
I thought you were dead.,brienne
I was only trying to protect her.,brienne
She's alive. Arya.,brienne
Winterfell.,brienne
The only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way.,brienne
Here we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a reunion.,tyrion lannister
"I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick. Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.",tyrion lannister
I'm sure your new queen--,bronn
You've been thinking about our new queen.,tyrion lannister
"And that would be double what now, exactly?",varys
Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right. Looking after myself.,bronn
"Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk.",tyrion lannister
"I put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is.",bronn
It's good to see you again.,tyrion lannister
"Yeah, you, too.",bronn
"Come on, Pod. Let's you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk, eh?",bronn
You might.,tyrion lannister
And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.,tyrion lannister
Where is she?,cersei lannister
She'll be here soon.,tyrion lannister
Didn't travel with you?,cersei lannister
No.,tyrion lannister
We've been here for some time.,cersei lannister
My apologies.,daenerys targaryen
We are all facing a unique,tyrion lannister
I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.,tyrion lannister
Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes? His wasn't even good. He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it.,tyrion lannister
Perhaps you ought to sit down.,jaime lannister
Sit down or leave.,cersei lannister
"We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face.",tyrion lannister
"So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?",cersei lannister
We all know that will never happen.,tyrion lannister
Then why are we here?,cersei lannister
This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.,jon snow
I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.,cersei lannister
This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't.,jon snow
"I don't think it's serious at all. I think it's another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking me for a truce.",cersei lannister
Yes. That's all.,daenerys targaryen
That's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.,cersei lannister
Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word.,daenerys targaryen
The word of a would-be usurper.,cersei lannister
There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you.,tyrion lannister
We can destroy them by burning them.,jon snow
"And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world.",jon snow
There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here.,jon snow
I didn't believe it until I saw them. I saw them all.,daenerys targaryen
How many?,jaime lannister
"A hundred thousand, at least.",daenerys targaryen
No.,jon snow
What are you talking about?,cersei lannister
"He's right to be afraid. And a coward to run. If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule. Everything we suffered will have been for nothing. Everything we lost will have been for nothing. The crown accepts your truce. Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy.",cersei lannister
"In return, the King",cersei lannister
Just the King,daenerys targaryen
"I would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark's son. I know Ned Stark's son.",cersei lannister
I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.,jon snow
Then there is nothing left to discuss. The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them. We will deal with whatever is left of you.,cersei lannister
Ser Jaime.,brienne
It's been good to see you. I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield.,jaime lannister
We both saw what just happened. We both saw that thing.,brienne
"Yes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them. But I'm loyal to the queen and you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother.",jaime lannister
"Oh, fuck loyalty!",brienne
Fuck loyalty?,jaime lannister
This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths. Talk to the queen.,brienne
And tell her what?,jaime lannister
I wish you hadn't done that.,davos
"I'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing.",daenerys targaryen
I know!,jon snow
I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen,tyrion lannister
I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father.,jon snow
That is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.,tyrion lannister
Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?,davos
"Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister.",tyrion lannister
I didn't come all this way to have my Hand,daenerys targaryen
I don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.,tyrion lannister
I did this. I should go.,jon snow
She'll definitely murder you. I go see my sister.,tyrion lannister
You spoke with her?,tyrion lannister
"At her until she kicked me out. She thinks I was an idiot to trust you. A lot of people seem to think that, actually.",jaime lannister
"I'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who's an idiot?",tyrion lannister
"I suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another.",jaime lannister
"I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place.",cersei lannister
"A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you.",tyrion lannister
"So you bring her here with her pet Northerner, whom you've convinced to bow down before her.",cersei lannister
I didn't know about that.,tyrion lannister
"And now you've got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you've worked towards your entire life.",cersei lannister
"Cersei, I didn't know.",tyrion lannister
the destruction of this family.,cersei lannister
I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.,tyrion lannister
You killed our father,cersei lannister
"After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me.",tyrion lannister
"Oh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen. No one wouldo ve touched them if Father--",cersei lannister
I have never been more sorry about anything.,tyrion lannister
"I will not hear it, not from you.",cersei lannister
I will not hear it!,cersei lannister
"All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So put an end to me.",tyrion lannister
"If it weren't for me, you'd have a motherIf it weren't for me, you'd have a father.",tyrion lannister
I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.,tyrion lannister
I will not,cersei lannister
I don't care. I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.,tyrion lannister
It doesn't matter. Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter. I don't care why you did what you did. I only care what it cost us. It cost us our future.,cersei lannister
"If there's no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?",tyrion lannister
Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.,cersei lannister
"Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something.",tyrion lannister
What did you hope for? To make Jon Snow submit to your queen.,cersei lannister
"Mm, not like this.",tyrion lannister
"But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her.",cersei lannister
Yes.,tyrion lannister
Why?,cersei lannister
Because I think she will make the world a better place.,tyrion lannister
You said she'd destroy King's Landing.,cersei lannister
She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.,tyrion lannister
That's the difference between you. I don't care about checking my worst impulses. I don't care about making the world a better place. Hang the world.,cersei lannister
"That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea. Get on a boat, take those who matter.",cersei lannister
You're pregnant.,tyrion lannister
No one is less happy about this than I am.,jon snow
"I know. I respect what you did. Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it.",daenerys targaryen
"This place was the beginning of the end for my family. A dragon is not a slave. They were terrifying. Extraordinary. They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here. They wasted away. They grew small. And we grew small as well. We weren't extraordinary without them. We were just like everyone else.",daenerys targaryen
You're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here.,jon snow
I can't have children.,daenerys targaryen
Who told you that?,jon snow
The witch who murdered my husband.,daenerys targaryen
Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?,jon snow
"You were right from the beginning. If I had trusted you, everything would be different.",daenerys targaryen
"So, what now?",jon snow
I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall. And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march north.,daenerys targaryen
It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked.,jon snow
"My armies will not stand down. I will not pull them back to the capital. I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War. The darkness is coming for us all. We'll face it together. And when the Great War is over, perhaps you'll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you. I expect not. Call our banners. All of them.",cersei lannister
It's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms. Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier.,petyr baelish
"No, this is the way he is, the way he's always been. He never asked for my opinion. Why would he start now?",sansa stark
I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you.,petyr baelish
"This is his writing, his signature. He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen. He's bent the knee.",sansa stark
I've heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful.,petyr baelish
What does that have to do with anything?,sansa stark
Jon is young and unmarried. Daenerys is young and unmarried.,petyr baelish
You think he wants to marry her?,sansa stark
"An alliance makes sense. Together, they'd be difficult to defeat. He was named King.",petyr baelish
"Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along. She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me, and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family.",sansa stark
"You are family, too. Would Arya really murder her own sister?",petyr baelish
Do you know what she is now? Do you know what the Faceless Men are?,sansa stark
"Only by reputation. They worship the God of Death, I believe. I never trust godly men.",petyr baelish
They're killers. And Arya was one of them. What do you think she's after?,sansa stark
She's your sister,petyr baelish
She could want me dead because she thinks I wronged my family.,sansa stark
Why did she come to Winterfell?,petyr baelish
To kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family.,sansa stark
Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write?,petyr baelish
To provide proof of my betrayals. To provide justification after she murders me.,sansa stark
"And after she murders you, what does she become?",petyr baelish
Lady,sansa stark
"If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight.",jon snow
"And the Unsullied? We can sail with them to White Harbor, meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad, then ride together to Winterfell.",daenerys targaryen
"Perhaps you should fly to Winterfell, Your Grace. You have many enemies in the North. Thousands fell fighting your fatherAll it takes is one angry man with a crossbow. He'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero. The man who killed the conqueror.",jorah mormont
"It's your decision, Your Grace. But if we're going to be allies in this war, it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies. If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message.",jon snow
I've not come to conquer the North. I'm coming to save the North. We sail together.,daenerys targaryen
Jon.,theon greyjoy
Can I speak with you?,theon greyjoy
All right.,jon snow
"What you did in King's Landing, what you said... You couldo ve lied to Cersei about bending the knee to Daenerys. You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth.",theon greyjoy
We went down there to make peace. And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together.,jon snow
"You've always known what was right. Even when we were all young and stupid, you always knew. Every step you take it's always the right step.",theon greyjoy
"It's not. It may seem that way from the outside, but I promise you, it's not true. I've done plenty of things that I regret.",jon snow
"Not compared to me, you haven't.",theon greyjoy
No. Not compared to you.,jon snow
I always wanted to do the right thing. Be the right kind of person. But I never knew what that meant. It always seemed like there's like there was an impossible choice I had to make. Stark or Greyjoy.,theon greyjoy
Our father was more of a father.,jon snow
He was.,theon greyjoy
And you betrayed him. Betrayed his memory.,jon snow
I did.,theon greyjoy
But you never lost him. He's a part of you. Just like he's a part of me.,jon snow
But the things I've done.,theon greyjoy
"It's not my place to forgive you for all of it. But what I can forgive, I do. You don't need to choose. You're a Greyjoy and you're a Stark.",jon snow
"When I was Ramsay's prisoner, Yara tried to save me. She's the only one who tried to save me. She needs me now.",theon greyjoy
"So, why are you still talking to me?",jon snow
All of us chose to follow Yara. We left the Iron Islands for Yara. She would never leave one of us behind. We're not leaving her behind.,theon greyjoy
She's not dead.,theon greyjoy
She's our queen,theon greyjoy
I did. I ran from my uncle.,theon greyjoy
We're done with all that.,theon greyjoy
"Yara did. She made a pledge. We're going to find her, and we're going to set her free.",theon greyjoy
Not for me. For Yara!,theon greyjoy
Have my sister,sansa stark
Are you sure you want to do this?,arya stark
It's not what I want. It's what honor demands.,sansa stark
And what does honor demand?,arya stark
That I defend my family from those who would harm us. That I defend the North from those who would betray us.,sansa stark
"All right, then. Get on with it.",arya stark
You stand accused of murder. You stand accused of treason. How do you answer these charges Lord Baelish?,sansa stark
My sister asked you a question.,arya stark
"Lady Sansa, forgive me I'm a bit confused.",petyr baelish
"Which charges confuse you? Let's start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn. You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall. Do you deny it?",sansa stark
I did it to protect you.,petyr baelish
"You did it to take power in the Vale. Earlier, you conspired to murder Jon.",sansa stark
Whatever your aunt,petyr baelish
You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon.,sansa stark
I know of no such letter.,petyr baelish
You conspired with Cersei Lannister and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father.,sansa stark
I deny it! None of you were there to see what happened. None of you knows the truth.,petyr baelish
You told our mother,arya stark
"Lady Sansa, I have known you since you were a girl. I've protected you.",petyr baelish
Protected me? By selling me to the Boltons?,sansa stark
"If we could speak alone, I can explain everything.",petyr baelish
"Sometimes when I'm trying to understand a person's motives, I play a little game. I assume the worst. What's the worst reason you have for turning me against my sisterThat's what you do, isn't it? That's what you've always done turn family against family, turn sister against sister. That's what you did to our mother.",sansa stark
"Sansa, please.",petyr baelish
"I'm a slow learner, it's true. But I learn.",sansa stark
Give me a chance to defend myself. I deserve that.,petyr baelish
I am Lord Protector of the Vale and I command you to escort me safely back to the Eyrie.,petyr baelish
"Sansa, I beg you! I loved your mother since the time I was a boy.",petyr baelish
"And yet, you betrayed her.",sansa stark
I loved you. More than anyone.,petyr baelish
"And yet, you betrayed me.",sansa stark
"When you brought me back to Winterfell, you told me there's no justice in the world, not unless we make it. Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish. I will never forget them.",sansa stark
Sansa! I--,petyr baelish
Our men in King's Landing will march north in three days' time.,jaime lannister
"We don't have a fortnight. If the North falls, we fall. Three days. The remaining forces in the Westerlands will take the river road east. We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town and march together to Winterfell.",jaime lannister
Ser Jaime.,cersei lannister
Your Grace.,jaime lannister
"My lords, I need a moment with my brother.",cersei lannister
What are you doing?,cersei lannister
Preparing the expedition north.,jaime lannister
"Expedition north? I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister. The Starks and Targaryens have united against us, and you want to fight alongside them? Are you a traitor or an idiot?",cersei lannister
You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy.,jaime lannister
I'll say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house. You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father.,cersei lannister
You saw it with your own eyes. You saw a dead man trying to kill us.,jaime lannister
"I saw it burn. If dragons can't stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them, how will our armies make a difference?",cersei lannister
"This isn't about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead!",jaime lannister
And I intend to stay amongst the living. Let the Stark boy and his new queen--,cersei lannister
I made a promise.,jaime lannister
Our child will rule Westeros.,cersei lannister
Our child will never be born if the dead come south.,jaime lannister
"The monsters are real. The white walkers, the dragons, the Dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young, they're all real. So be it. Let the monsters kill each other. And while they battle in the North, we take back the lands that belong to us.",cersei lannister
And then what?,jaime lannister
And then we rule.,cersei lannister
"When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins. You understand that, don't you? If the dead win, they march south and kill us all. If the living win, and we've betrayed them, they march south and kill us all!",jaime lannister
The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all. Most of them will die in the North.,cersei lannister
I faced them in the field. We can't beat them. We can't beat their dragons.,jaime lannister
How many dragons did you see at the pit?,cersei lannister
Two.,jaime lannister
What happened to the third?,cersei lannister
"For all we know, it's guarding her fleet!",jaime lannister
"She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied. She came here to show us all her power. No, something happened.The dragons are vulnerable.",cersei lannister
We can't beat the Dothraki. We don't have the numbers. We don't have the support of the other houses!,jaime lannister
"No, we have something better. We have the Iron Bank. You shouldo ve listened more when Father--",cersei lannister
The Golden Company is not here. They're in Essos. How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?,jaime lannister
Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands? Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen?,cersei lannister
"You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me, the commander.",jaime lannister
"And you conspired with Tyrion, the man who murdered our father without telling me, your queen.",cersei lannister
I didn't conspire with him.,jaime lannister
You met with him in secret without my consent. You planned to promote my enemies' interests. That is the definition of conspiracy.,cersei lannister
I pledged to ride north. I intend to honor that pledge.,jaime lannister
And that will be treason.,cersei lannister
Treason?,jaime lannister
Disobeying your queen,cersei lannister
Doesn't matter what I'd call it.,jaime lannister
I told you no one walks away from me.,cersei lannister
"Are you going to order him to kill me? I'm the only one you have left. Our children are gone, our father",jaime lannister
There's one more yet to come.,cersei lannister
"Give the order, then.",jaime lannister
I don't believe you.,jaime lannister
I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.,sam
"Oh, well, thank you, but, um, I'm not sure that I am. What happened to you beyond the Wall?",sam
Oh! I don't know what that means.,sam
"Um, Jon's the one to lead the fight against the dead. I know he is. But he can't do it alone, so I've come here to help him.",sam
Oh.,sam
The truth about what?,sam
It's not.,sam
"At the Citadel, I transcribed a High Septon's diary. He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia. He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony.",sam
It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary. I don't know why he'd lie. Is this something you can see?,sam
Are you all right?,arya stark
"It's just strange. In his own horrible way, I believe he loved me.",sansa stark
You did the right thing.,arya stark
You did it.,sansa stark
I'm just the executioner. You passed the sentence. You're the Lady.,arya stark
Does that bother you?,sansa stark
I was never going to be as good a lady as you. So I had to be something else. I never could have survived what you survived.,arya stark
You would have. You're the strongest person I know.,sansa stark
I believe that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.,arya stark
"Well, don't get used to it. You're still very strange and annoying.",sansa stark
"In winter, we must protect ourselves. Look after one another.",arya stark
Father,sansa stark
I miss him.,arya stark
"Me, too.",sansa stark
You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won't freeze off.,tyrion lannister
"You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?",varys
"Because I have balls, and you don't.",tyrion lannister
I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.,jon snow
Look at you.,jon snow
You're a man.,jon snow
Where's Arya?,jon snow
Lurking somewhere.,sansa stark
"Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell.",jon snow
"Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark. The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you.",daenerys targaryen
"Winterfell is yours, Your Grace.",sansa stark
"As soon as we heard about the Wall, I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell. Lord Umber when can we expect your people to arrive?",sansa stark
You'll have as many as we can spare. Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.,sansa stark
We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here.,jon snow
It's not important.,jon snow
"You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. I'll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North.",jon snow
"If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause.",tyrion lannister
"I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die.",tyrion lannister
"May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? While I ensured our stores would last through winter, I didn't account for Dothraki, Unsullied and two full-grown dragons. What do dragons eat, anyway?",sansa stark
Whatever they want.,daenerys targaryen
My lord. My lady.,tyrion lannister
The Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it.,tyrion lannister
"So does Hand of the Queen. Depending on the queen, I suppose.",sansa stark
Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair.,tyrion lannister
It had its moments.,sansa stark
Apologies for leaving like that.,sansa stark
"Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder.",tyrion lannister
We both survived.,sansa stark
Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.,tyrion lannister
"I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you'll be safe-",tyrion lannister
Cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you?,sansa stark
She did.,tyrion lannister
And you believed her?,sansa stark
She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.,tyrion lannister
I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.,sansa stark
You used to be taller.,arya stark
How did you sneak up on me?,jon snow
How did you survive a knife through the heart?,arya stark
I didn't.,jon snow
You still have it.,jon snow
Needle.,arya stark
Have you ever used it?,jon snow
Once or twice.,arya stark
Valyrian steel.,arya stark
Jealous?,jon snow
Too heavy for me.,arya stark
Where were you before? I couldo ve used your help with Sansa.,jon snow
"She doesn't like your queen, does she?",arya stark
Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.,jon snow
She's the smartest person I've ever met.,arya stark
Now you're defending her?,jon snow
You?,jon snow
I'm defending our family. So is she.,arya stark
Yeah. I'm her family too.,jon snow
Don't forget that.,arya stark
Good.,cersei lannister
"Twenty-thousand men, is it?",cersei lannister
Horses?,cersei lannister
And elephants?,cersei lannister
That's disappointing. I was told the Golden Company had elephants.,cersei lannister
"In any event, you are most welcome here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland.",cersei lannister
You are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest.,cersei lannister
After the war. That was our agreement.,cersei lannister
"You want a whore, buy one. You want a queen, earn her.",cersei lannister
You're insolent. I've executed men for less.,cersei lannister
I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.,bronn
Nearly killed it.,bronn
"All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?",bronn
You're kidding me.,bronn
"Sorry, ladies. Another time perhaps.",bronn
Which girl?,bronn
"She once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them.",bronn
"So, she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers. If it's the Dragon Queen she's after-",bronn
"Yeah, well, good luck with that.",bronn
That fucking family.,bronn
I wanted those elephants.,cersei lannister
You're insulting my late husband?,cersei lannister
"Robert had a different whore every night, but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body.",cersei lannister
"You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?",cersei lannister
"You're not boring, I'll give you that.",cersei lannister
You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met. I like that.,cersei lannister
But now I want to be alone.,cersei lannister
Daenerys went north.,theon greyjoy
You're my queen. I go where you command.,theon greyjoy
What is dead may never die.,theon greyjoy
The Karstarks.,varys
"One of the better sigils. Beats an onion, anyway.",tyrion lannister
Can't argue with that.,davos
"Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield. Jon Snow brought peace to the houses.",davos
And our queen is grateful.,tyrion lannister
"Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point. The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her. They don't know her. The Free Folk don't know her. I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you, they're stubborn as goats. You want their loyalty, you have to earn it.",davos
I sense that you're leading to a proposal.,tyrion lannister
"A proposal is what I'm proposing. On the off chance that we survive the Night King, what if the Seven Kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history, were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?",davos
They do make a handsome couple.,tyrion lannister
You overestimate our influence. Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.,varys
I'm not that old.,tyrion lannister
Not as old as him.,tyrion lannister
Our queen respects the wisdom of age.,tyrion lannister
"Of course she does. Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth.",varys
What is that?,tyrion lannister
Nothing lasts.,varys
Your sister doesn't like me.,daenerys targaryen
"She doesn't know you. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up.",jon snow
She doesn't need to be my friend but I am her queen. If she can't respect me-,daenerys targaryen
How many today?,daenerys targaryen
What's the matter?,jon snow
The dragons are barely eating.,daenerys targaryen
What's wrong with them?,jon snow
They don't like the North.,daenerys targaryen
Go on.,daenerys targaryen
I don't know how to ride a dragon.,jon snow
Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon.,daenerys targaryen
What if he doesn't want me to?,jon snow
"Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow.",daenerys targaryen
What do I hold onto?,jon snow
Whatever you can.,daenerys targaryen
You've completely ruined horses for me.,jon snow
We could stay a thousand years-,daenerys targaryen
No one would find us.,daenerys targaryen
We'd be pretty old.,jon snow
It's cold up here for a southern girl.,jon snow
So keep your queen warm.,daenerys targaryen
Don't be afraid.,daenerys targaryen
Leave him be.,arya stark
First I robbed you.,arya stark
That was a nice ax you made for him. You've gotten better.,arya stark
Thanks. So do you.,arya stark
"Stay close to that forge, then.",arya stark
Don't call me that.,arya stark
Here's my wish.,arya stark
Can you make it?,arya stark
Can you make it or not?,arya stark
You don't know any other rich girls.,arya stark
Come in.,sansa stark
"Lord Glover wishes us good fortune, but he's staying in Deepwood Motte with his men.",sansa stark
"House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years."" Isn't that what he said?",jon snow
"I will stand behind Jon Snow,"" he said.",sansa stark
The King in the North.,sansa stark
I told you we needed allies.,jon snow
You didn't tell me you were going to abandon your crown.,sansa stark
"I never wanted a crown. All I wanted was to protect the North. I brought two armies home with me, two dragons.",jon snow
And a Targaryen queen.,sansa stark
"Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance.",jon snow
Do you have any faith in me at all?,jon snow
You know I do.,sansa stark
She'll be a good queen. For all of us. She's not her father.,jon snow
"No, she's much prettier.",sansa stark
Did you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her?,sansa stark
So you're the man?,daenerys targaryen
The one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could.,daenerys targaryen
"They could, they just wouldn't.",jorah mormont
I'll have to make some changes in the Citadel when I take my throne. A great service merits a great reward.,daenerys targaryen
"Well, there must be something I could give you.",daenerys targaryen
For what crime?,daenerys targaryen
From the Citadel?,daenerys targaryen
Not Randyll Tarly?,daenerys targaryen
I offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee. He refused.,daenerys targaryen
Your brother stood with your father.,daenerys targaryen
Of course.,daenerys targaryen
Sam?,jon snow
Were you hiding from me?,jon snow
What are you doing in Winterfell? Or did you read every book in the Citadel already?,jon snow
What's wrong? Gilly? Is she all right?,jon snow
Little Sam?,jon snow
Know what?,jon snow
I'm so sorry. We need to end this war.,jon snow
"Well, I've executed men who disobeyed me.",jon snow
I wasn't a king.,jon snow
"I gave up my crown, Sam.",jon snow
I bent the knee. I'm not King in the North anymore.,jon snow
What are you talking about?,jon snow
My father was the most honorable man I ever met. You're saying he lied to me all my life.,jon snow
Daenerys is our queen.,jon snow
That's treason.,jon snow
"When I was a child, my brother would tell me a bedtime story about the man who murdered our father.",daenerys targaryen
Who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat. Who sat down on the Iron Throne and watched as his blood poured onto the floor.,daenerys targaryen
He told me other stories as well. About all the things we would do to that man once we took back the Seven Kingdoms and had him in our grasp.,daenerys targaryen
Your sister pledged to send her army north.,daenerys targaryen
She did.,jaime lannister
"I don't see an army. I see one man, with one hand. It appears your sister lied to me.",daenerys targaryen
She lied to me as well. She never had any intention of sending her army north.,jaime lannister
"She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet and 20,000 fresh troops. The Golden Company from Essos, bought and paid for. Even if we defeat the dead, she'll have more than enough to destroy the survivors.",jaime lannister
"We""?",daenerys targaryen
I promised to fight for the living. I intend to keep that promise.,jaime lannister
"Your Grace, I know my brother-",tyrion lannister
Like you knew your sister?,daenerys targaryen
"He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received. Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?",tyrion lannister
"Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat.",daenerys targaryen
"You're right. We can't trust him. He attacked my father in the streets. He tried to destroy my house and my family, the same as he did yours.",sansa stark
"Do you want me to apologize? I won't. We were at war. Everything I did, I did for my house and my family. I'd do it all again.",jaime lannister
So why have you abandoned your house and family now?,daenerys targaryen
Because this goes beyond loyalty.,jaime lannister
This is about survival.,jaime lannister
"You don't know me well, Your Grace.",brienne
"But I know Ser Jaime. He is a man of honor. I was his captor once. But when we were both taken prisoner and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me, Ser Jaime defended me. And lost his hand because of it.",brienne
"Without him, my lady, you would not be alive. He armed me, armored me, and sent me to find you and bring you home because he'd sworn an oath to your mother.",brienne
You vouch for him?,sansa stark
I do.,brienne
You would fight beside him?,sansa stark
I would.,brienne
"I trust you with my life. If you trust him with yours, we should let him stay.",sansa stark
What does the Warden of the North say about it?,daenerys targaryen
We need every man we can get.,jon snow
Very well.,daenerys targaryen
"Thank you, Your Grace.",jaime lannister
"Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know at all. Which makes you either a traitor or a fool.",daenerys targaryen
I was a fool.,tyrion lannister
Not for the first time.,daenerys targaryen
"Cersei still sits on the throne. If you can't help me take it back, I'll find another Hand who can.",daenerys targaryen
I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over.,tyrion lannister
You make my weapon yet?,arya stark
You should make mine first. And make sure it's stronger than this.,arya stark
Are you going to be down in the crypt?,arya stark
But you're a fighter.,arya stark
You've fought them?,arya stark
How many?,arya stark
What are they like?,arya stark
"Really bad""?",arya stark
"Even a smith's apprentice can do better than ""really bad."" What do they look like? What do they smell like? How do they move? How hard are they to kill?",arya stark
I know Death.,arya stark
He's got many faces.,arya stark
I look forward to seeing this one.,arya stark
My weapon?,arya stark
I'm sorry for what I did to you.,jaime lannister
I'm not that person anymore.,jaime lannister
You're not?,jaime lannister
You're not angry at me.,jaime lannister
Why didn't you tell them?,jaime lannister
What about afterwards?,jaime lannister
"Well, here we are.",tyrion lannister
"Yes, here we are.",jaime lannister
Together again.,tyrion lannister
And the masses rejoice.,tyrion lannister
How do they feel about their new queen?,jaime lannister
She's your new queen too.,tyrion lannister
They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They'll come around once they see Daenerys is different.,tyrion lannister
And she is? Different?,jaime lannister
She is.,tyrion lannister
You're sure about her?,jaime lannister
I am.,tyrion lannister
She didn't seem sure about you.,jaime lannister
It's hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents.,tyrion lannister
Hmm.,jaime lannister
Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her.,tyrion lannister
Was she lying about the baby too?,tyrion lannister
"No, that part is real.",jaime lannister
She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies. I wouldn't be too hard on yourself. She's fooled me more than anybody.,jaime lannister
What?,jaime lannister
"She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway.",tyrion lannister
"So we're going to die at Winterfell. Not the death I wouldo ve chosen. I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and-",tyrion lannister
Your cock.,jaime lannister
My cock.,tyrion lannister
At least Cersei won't get to murder me. I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.,tyrion lannister
Maybe after I'm dead I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart.,tyrion lannister
Ser Jaime.,brienne
Lady Brienne.,jaime lannister
He's come a long way.,jaime lannister
He's alright. Still has a lot to learn.,brienne
I'm sure you'll teach him. I've been told you're commanding the left flank.,jaime lannister
"I am. It's, uh-it's good ground.",brienne
It is.,jaime lannister
"The rise, it should give us some advantage.",brienne
"If we can keep a tight formation, we might be able to beat them back.",brienne
"Yes, I think you're right.",jaime lannister
What are you doing?,brienne
I think you know.,brienne
I truly don't.,jaime lannister
We have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me. Not once.,brienne
You want me to insult you?,jaime lannister
No!,brienne
Good.,jaime lannister
"I came to Winterfell because-I'm not the fighter I used to be. But I'd be honored to serve under your command, if you'll have me.",jaime lannister
I better get back.,brienne
"Forgive me, khaleesi.",jorah mormont
Have you done something to offend me?,daenerys targaryen
Many things.,jorah mormont
Long ago and long forgiven.,daenerys targaryen
"But you did forgive, despite my failures. When I heard you'd named Tyrion your Hand, it broke my heart.",jorah mormont
"When I named him Hand, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.",daenerys targaryen
You made the right choice.,jorah mormont
I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.,daenerys targaryen
I didn't. His mouth hardly stopped moving between Volantis and Meereen. It was all I could do not to throw him in the sea.,jorah mormont
But the mind behind all those words-,jorah mormont
He's made mistakes. Serious mistakes.,daenerys targaryen
As have we all. He owns his and learns from them.,jorah mormont
You're advising me to forgive the man who stole your position?,daenerys targaryen
"I am. And one other suggestion, if you'll allow me.",jorah mormont
Keep them open for as long as you can. There are still people coming in from the countryside.,sansa stark
"Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone.",daenerys targaryen
I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before. About Ser Jaime.,daenerys targaryen
"Brienne has been loyal to me, always. I trust her more than anyone.",sansa stark
I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.,daenerys targaryen
Tyrion is a good man. He was never anything but decent towards me.,sansa stark
I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.,daenerys targaryen
"I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be. He never should have trusted Cersei.",daenerys targaryen
You never should have either.,sansa stark
I thought he knew his sister.,daenerys targaryen
Families are complicated.,sansa stark
Ours certainly have been.,daenerys targaryen
A sad thing to have in common.,sansa stark
"We have other things in common. We've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule. And we've both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell.",daenerys targaryen
"And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another. Why is that? Your brother.",daenerys targaryen
"He loves you, you know that.",sansa stark
That bothers you.,daenerys targaryen
Men do stupid things for women. They're easily manipulated.,sansa stark
"All my life, I've known one goal",daenerys targaryen
I should have thanked you the moment you arrived. That was a mistake.,sansa stark
"I'm here because I love your brother and I trust him, and I know he's true to his word. He's only the second man in my life I can say that about.",daenerys targaryen
Who was the first?,sansa stark
Someone taller.,daenerys targaryen
"And what happens afterwards? We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei. What happens then?",sansa stark
I take the Iron Throne.,daenerys targaryen
"What about the North? It was taken from us, and we took it back. And we said we'd never bow to anyone else again. What about the North?",sansa stark
What is it?,daenerys targaryen
My queen.,theon greyjoy
Your sister?,daenerys targaryen
"She only has a few ships, and she couldn't sail them here. So, she's sailing to the Iron Islands instead, to take them back in your name.",theon greyjoy
But why aren't you with her?,daenerys targaryen
"I want to fight for Winterfell, Lady Sansa, if you'll have me.",theon greyjoy
"You are now. Look, I made it through most of my years without ever getting near a fight, but then I survived the Battle of the Bastards. Right outside these walls. If I can live through that, you can live through this. They'll outfit you with weapons at the forge. Right that way.",davos
Which way do you want to go?,davos
I'm sure a lot of people would.,davos
I thought we'd lost you.,jon snow
How did you find each other?,jon snow
The Umbers?,jon snow
How long do we have?,jon snow
They're coming.,jon snow
We have dragonglass and Valyrian steel.,jon snow
But there are too many of them.,jon snow
Far too many.,jon snow
Our enemy doesn't tire.,jon snow
Doesn't stop. Doesn't feel.,jon snow
We can't beat them in a straight fight.,jon snow
"So, what can we do?",jaime lannister
The Night King made them all. They follow his command. If he falls Getting to him may be our best chance.,jon snow
"If that's true, he'll never expose himself.",jaime lannister
How will he find you?,tyrion lannister
"We'll put you in the crypt, where it's safest.",jon snow
You want us to use you as bait?,sansa stark
We're not leaving you alone out there.,arya stark
He won't be. I'll stay with him. With the Ironborn. I took this castle from you. Let me defend you now.,theon greyjoy
We'll hold off the rest of them for as long as we can.,davos
"When the time comes, Ser Davos and I will be on the walls, to give you the signal to light the trench.",tyrion lannister
Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own. You'll be in the crypt.,daenerys targaryen
"Your Grace, I have fought before, I can do it again. Alongside the men and women risking their lives.",tyrion lannister
"There are thousands of them and only one of you. You can't fight as well as they can, but you can think better than any of them. You're here because of your mind. If we survive, I'll need it.",daenerys targaryen
The dragons should give us an edge in the field.,davos
"If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran. We need to be near him. Not too near, or the Night King won't come. But close enough to pursue him when he does.",jon snow
Dragonfire will stop him?,arya stark
Let's get some rest.,jon snow
Your Grace.,jon snow
Do you need help?,tyrion lannister
You've had a strange journey.,tyrion lannister
I'd like to hear about it.,tyrion lannister
"If only we were trapped in a castle, in the middle of winter, with nowhere to go.",tyrion lannister
No.,jon snow
Gilly? Little Sam?,jon snow
If you want to join them.,jon snow
To protect them.,jon snow
Now it's just us three.,jon snow
I wish Father were here.,tyrion lannister
I would love to see the look on his face when he realizes his two sons are about to die defending Winterfell.,tyrion lannister
That would be something to see.,jaime lannister
"I remember the first time we were here, the first time I saw this hall.",tyrion lannister
Mm.,jaime lannister
You were a golden lion. I was a drunken whore-monger. It was all so simple.,tyrion lannister
It wasn't so simple. I was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the world who was sleeping with his sister.,jaime lannister
I was speaking in relative terms.,tyrion lannister
Do you miss it?,jaime lannister
Of course I miss it.,tyrion lannister
"Well, my golden lion days are done, but whore-mongering is still an option for you.",jaime lannister
It's not. Things would be easier if it were.,tyrion lannister
The perils of self-betterment.,tyrion lannister
Oh! My lady.,jaime lannister
"Oh, we didn't mean to interrupt. We were just looking for somewhere warm to-",brienne
To contemplate your imminent death. You've come to the right place. You want some of this piss? It's not bad. It's not good either.,tyrion lannister
I don't think that's wise.,brienne
The battle might start at any moment.,brienne
Half cup.,brienne
And you?,tyrion lannister
"No, thank you. I should try and get some sleep.",brienne
You really think any of us are going to sleep tonight? Join us.,jaime lannister
All right. Just a bit.,brienne
"Well, what do we have here?",davos
"Ser Davos, join us.",tyrion lannister
"No, not for me, thanks. Came here for this.",davos
I figured I could wait to die freezing my balls off out there or wait to die nice and warm in here.,davos
"Yes, well, I'm glad you're here.",brienne
Here fighting with us. Glad you survived Eastwatch.,brienne
Would you like a drink?,tyrion lannister
I'm sure someone does.,jaime lannister
Maybe I will have that drink.,davos
Guess I've changed.,arya stark
What are you doing up here?,arya stark
"No, I mean, what are you doing up here? You joined the Brotherhood. You went beyond the Wall with Jon. You're here now. Why? When was the last time you fought for anyone but yourself?",arya stark
For a little while.,arya stark
I'm not spending my final hours with you two miserable old shits.,arya stark
That for me?,arya stark
This'll work.,arya stark
What did the Red Woman want with you?,arya stark
Why your blood?,arya stark
Was that your first time?,arya stark
Your first time with a woman.,arya stark
Were you with other girls before that in King's Landing?,arya stark
Or after?,arya stark
You don't remember?,arya stark
One? Two? Twenty?,arya stark
"Yes, you did.",arya stark
We're probably going to die soon. I want to know what it's like before that happens.,arya stark
I'm not the Red Woman. Take your own bloody pants off.,arya stark
"It's strange, isn't it? Almost everyone here's fought the Starks at one time or another. And here we are in their castle, ready to defend it. Together.",tyrion lannister
At least we'll die with honor.,brienne
I think we might live.,tyrion lannister
I-I do. How many battles have we survived between us? Ser Davos Seaworth. Survivor of both the Blackwater and the Battle of the Bastards.,tyrion lannister
All without a shred of combat ability.,davos
"Mm. Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke.",tyrion lannister
Fabled loser of the Battle of Whispering Wood.,jaime lannister
"Hear, hear! Ser Brienne of Tarth. Defeated the Hound in-Pardon me, Lady Brienne.",tyrion lannister
Women can't be knights.,brienne
Tradition.,brienne
I don't even want to be a knight.,brienne
You don't need a king. Any knight can make another knight.,jaime lannister
I'll prove it.,jaime lannister
"Kneel, Lady Brienne.",jaime lannister
Do you want to be a knight or not? Kneel.,jaime lannister
"In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.",jaime lannister
"In the name of the Father, I charge you to be just.",jaime lannister
"In the name of the Mother, I charge you to defend the innocent.",jaime lannister
"Arise, Brienne of Tarth a knight of the Seven Kingdoms.",jaime lannister
Ser Brienne of Tarth! Knight of the Seven Kingdoms!,tyrion lannister
We have all we need to win this war.,jorah mormont
"Please, listen to me. You're the future of our house.",jorah mormont
You'll be safer in the crypt. These things we're fighting-,jorah mormont
"Thank you, my lady.",jorah mormont
What have you got there?,jorah mormont
You still have a family.,jorah mormont
I'll wield it in his memory to guard the realms of men.,jorah mormont
We'd better get some rest.,jaime lannister
"No, let's stay a bit longer.",tyrion lannister
We're out of wine.,davos
How about a song? One of you must know one. Ser Davos?,tyrion lannister
You'll pray for a quick death.,davos
Ser Brienne?,tyrion lannister
Mmm.,tyrion lannister
Who's that?,daenerys targaryen
Lyanna Stark.,jon snow
"My brother, Rhaegar, everyone told me he was decent and kind. He liked to sing. Gave money to poor children. And he raped her.",daenerys targaryen
He didn't. He loved her.,jon snow
"They were married in secret. After Rhaegar fell on the Trident, she had a son. Robert would have murdered the baby if he ever found out, and Lyanna knew it. So the last thing she did, as she bled to death on her birthing bed, was give the boy to her brother, Ned Stark, to raise as his bastard.",jon snow
My name. My real name is Aegon Targaryen.,jon snow
That's impossible.,daenerys targaryen
I wish it were.,jon snow
Who told you this?,daenerys targaryen
Bran. He saw it.,jon snow
He saw it?,daenerys targaryen
And Samwell confirmed it. He read about their marriage at the Citadel without even knowing what it meant.,jon snow
A secret no one in the world knew except your brother and your best friend. Doesn't seem strange to you?,daenerys targaryen
"It's true, Dany. I know it is.",jon snow
"If it were true, it would make you the last male heir of House Targaryen. You'd have a claim to the Iron Throne.",daenerys targaryen
Open the gate!,davos
The Night King is coming.,jon snow
The dead are already here.,daenerys targaryen
Stand your ground!,brienne
Get down to the crypt.,arya stark
I'm not abandoning my people.,sansa stark
Take this and go.,arya stark
I don't know how to use it.,sansa stark
Stick them with the pointy end.,arya stark
Fall back!,brienne
Dany!,jon snow
Hey! Hey! Hey!,brienne
Go! Hey! Go! Go!,brienne
Get in! Get in! Get in! Come on!,jaime lannister
They're coming! Come on!,jaime lannister
She can't see us.,davos
Light the trenches!,davos
At least we're already in a crypt.,varys
"If we were up there, we might see something everyone else is missing. Something that makes a difference.",tyrion lannister
What? Remember the Battle of Blackwater? I brought us through the Mud Gate.,tyrion lannister
And got your face cut in half.,varys
And it made a difference. If I was out there right now...,tyrion lannister
You'd die. There's nothing you can do.,sansa stark
You might be surprised at the lengths I'd go to avoid joining the Army of the Dead. I could think of no organization less suited to my talents.,tyrion lannister
"Witty remarks won't make a difference. That's why we're down here, none of us can do anything. It's the truth. It's the most heroic thing we can do now look the truth in the face.",sansa stark
Maybe we should have stayed married.,tyrion lannister
You were the best of them.,sansa stark
What a terrifying thought.,tyrion lannister
It wouldn't work between us.,sansa stark
Why not?,tyrion lannister
The Dragon Queen. Your divided loyalties would become a problem.,sansa stark
They lit the trench. Bran I just want you to know... I wish... The things I did,theon greyjoy
Go where?,theon greyjoy
Man the walls!,davos
"Come on. Come on! Come on! Go, go, go!",jaime lannister
Come on!,brienne
Get in there!,jaime lannister
Relieve the archers!,jaime lannister
Archers on top!,jaime lannister
Go! Go.,jorah mormont
Draw!,jaime lannister
Come on!,jaime lannister
Look out!,jaime lannister
I know you.,arya stark
You said we'd meet again.,arya stark
You said I'd shut many eyes forever. You were right about that too.,arya stark
Not today.,arya stark
Here they come!,theon greyjoy
"Steady, lads.",theon greyjoy
Steady now. Make every shot count.,theon greyjoy
Get off!,jon snow
Dracarys.,daenerys targaryen
"Come on! Come on! No! No, no, no!",tyrion lannister
Bran!,jon snow
Go!,daenerys targaryen
Jorah!,daenerys targaryen
I'm hurt.,jorah mormont
We're here to say goodbye to our brothers and sisters. To our fathers and mothers. To our friends. Our fellow men and women who set aside their differences to fight together and die together so that others might live. Everyone in this world owes them a debt that can never be repaid. It is our duty and our honor to keep them alive in memory for those who come after us and those who come after them for as long as men draw breath. They were the shields that guarded the realms of men. And we shall never see their like again.,jon snow
Gendry.,daenerys targaryen
"That's right, isn't it?",daenerys targaryen
You're Robert Baratheon's son.,daenerys targaryen
You are aware he took my family's throne and tried to have me murdered?,daenerys targaryen
"Yes, he's dead. His brothers are too. So who's Lord of Storm's End now?",daenerys targaryen
Does anyone?,daenerys targaryen
I think you should be Lord of Storm's End.,daenerys targaryen
"No, you are Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End, the lawful son of Robert Baratheon. Because that is what I have made you.",daenerys targaryen
To Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End.,davos
A fitting reward for a hero.,tyrion lannister
"Uh, hold on.",sam
And a Lord of Storm's End who will be forever loyal to you.,tyrion lannister
See? You're not the only one who's clever.,daenerys targaryen
"We fought dead things and lived to talk about it. If this isn't the time to drink, when is?",jaime lannister
"The last time I saw her, I told her I'd kill her if I ever saw her again.",davos
I'm sure you had your reasons.,tyrion lannister
I did. I do.,davos
So did you?,tyrion lannister
"Never got the chance. She did it to herself. Or her god did it to her. Lord of Light. We play his game for him, we fight his war and win, and then he fucks off. No signs, no blessings. Who knows what he wants?",davos
I don't imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before.,tyrion lannister
And what if I'm not trying to be happy?,davos
"Then you're in luck. We may have defeated them, but we still have us to contend with.",tyrion lannister
Thank you. I feel much better.,davos
This is clever. Even better than the saddle I designed for you.,tyrion lannister
You know our history better than anyone. That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.,tyrion lannister
You're the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark.,tyrion lannister
You don't want it.,tyrion lannister
I envy you.,tyrion lannister
Come in.,varys
And?,varys
Nothing?,varys
We'll try again at supper.,varys
Who?,varys
Of course they are. That's their job.,varys
"What have I told you, Martha?",varys
Go on. They'll be missing you in the kitchen.,varys
The Northern armies?,varys
Just crossed the Trident. They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days. How is she?,jon snow
"She hasn't seen anyone since we returned. Hasn't left her chambers, hasn't accepted any food.",varys
She shouldn't be alone.,jon snow
You're worried for her. I admire your empathy.,varys
Aren't you worried for her?,jon snow
"I'm worried for all of us. They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath.",varys
We're not much for riddles where I'm from.,jon snow
We both know what she's about to do.,varys
That's her decision to make. She is our queen.,jon snow
"Men decide where power resides, whether or not they know it.",varys
What do you want?,jon snow
All I've ever wanted. The right ruler on the Iron Throne. I still don't know how her coin has landed. But I'm quite certain about yours.,varys
I don't want it. I never have.,jon snow
"I have known more kings and queens than any man living. I've heard what they say to crowds, and seen what they do in the shadows. I have furthered their designs, however horrible. But what I tell you now is true",varys
She is my queen.,jon snow
Your Grace?,tyrion lannister
There's something you need to know.,tyrion lannister
Someone has betrayed me.,daenerys targaryen
Yes.,tyrion lannister
Jon Snow.,daenerys targaryen
Varys.,tyrion lannister
He knows the truth about Jon.,daenerys targaryen
He does.,tyrion lannister
"Because you told him. You learned from Sansa. And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her. As I said, he betrayed me.",daenerys targaryen
I'm glad Sansa told me. I am your Hand. I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.,tyrion lannister
And Varys?,daenerys targaryen
Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.,tyrion lannister
You spoke to him first. Without coming to me. Without asking my permission.,daenerys targaryen
It was a mistake.,tyrion lannister
Why do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain?,daenerys targaryen
She trusts me.,tyrion lannister
"Yes, she trusts you. She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen. And you did not let her down.",daenerys targaryen
"If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me. Our intentions were good. We wanted what you want. A better world, all of us. Varys as much as anyone.",tyrion lannister
But it doesn't matter now.,tyrion lannister
No. It doesn't matter now.,daenerys targaryen
It was me.,tyrion lannister
"I hope I deserve this. Truly, I do. I hope I'm wrong. Goodbye, old friend.",varys
"Lord Varys. I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons ...",daenerys targaryen
sentence you to die. Dracarys.,daenerys targaryen
This was all she brought with her when we crossed the Narrow Sea. Her only possession.,daenerys targaryen
"It's all right, Torgo Nudo. Let me speak with him.",daenerys targaryen
What did I say would happen if you told your sister?,daenerys targaryen
"I don't want it, and that's what I told him.",jon snow
She betrayed your trust. She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don't have love here. I only have fear.,daenerys targaryen
I love you. And you will always be my queen.,jon snow
Is that all I am to you? Your queen?,daenerys targaryen
"All right, then.",daenerys targaryen
Let it be fear.,daenerys targaryen
"The people who live there, they're not your enemies. They're innocents, like the ones you liberated in Meereen.",tyrion lannister
"In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived.",daenerys targaryen
They're afraid. Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered. You can't expect them to be heroes. They're hostages.,tyrion lannister
They are. In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?,daenerys targaryen
What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns.,tyrion lannister
Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them. That's what she thinks our mercy is - weakness.,daenerys targaryen
"I beg you, my queen-",tyrion lannister
But she's wrong. Mercy is our strength. Our mercy towards future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.,daenerys targaryen
"Ready the Unsullied. Tonight you sail for King's Landing, to join the Northern armies.",daenerys targaryen
"Cersei's followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost. Give them that chance. If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates. Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack.",tyrion lannister
Wait for me outside the city. You'll know when it's time.,daenerys targaryen
Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines.,daenerys targaryen
It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all. The next time you fail me will be the last time you fail me.,daenerys targaryen
The rearguard should be here by daybreak.,davos
She wants to attack now.,tyrion lannister
Daybreak at the earliest.,jon snow
"Davos. I need to ask you a favor. You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you?",tyrion lannister
"I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?",davos
I'm Arya Stark. I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.,arya stark
I drink to eat the skull keeper.,tyrion lannister
I want to eat the skull keeper.,tyrion lannister
I want to see the ...,tyrion lannister
Ah. Good. I want to be alone with the prisoner. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.,tyrion lannister
Ordered by whom? The queen herself?,tyrion lannister
"Well, in that case, as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order. Probably by quite a lot.",tyrion lannister
How did they find you?,tyrion lannister
Did you consider taking it off?,tyrion lannister
"Cersei once called me ""the stupidest Lannister.""",jaime lannister
"And you're going back to her, to die with her.",tyrion lannister
You've underestimated her before.,jaime lannister
She's going to die. Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.,tyrion lannister
Difficult to do from here.,jaime lannister
When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?,jaime lannister
"Try. If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise.",tyrion lannister
"To be honest, I never really cared much for them. Innocent or otherwise.",jaime lannister
You do care for one innocent. I know you do. And so does Cersei. She has a reason now.,tyrion lannister
"The child is the reason she'll never give an inch. All the worst things she's ever done, she's done for her children. It's not impossible that she'll win.",jaime lannister
"She won't. Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be.",tyrion lannister
Two of the three dragons are dead. She's evened the odds.,jaime lannister
The city will fall tomorrow.,tyrion lannister
"She has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company-",jaime lannister
I defended the city last time it was attacked. I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow.,tyrion lannister
"Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before.",jaime lannister
Why?,tyrion lannister
"Escape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go. You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos. Start a new life.",tyrion lannister
Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life? Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war-,jaime lannister
"There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again.",tyrion lannister
Swear to me.,tyrion lannister
You have my word.,jaime lannister
"If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates. That will be our signal that the city has surrendered.",tyrion lannister
I'll try.,jaime lannister
"I never thought I'd get to repay the favor. Remember, ring the bells and open the gates.",tyrion lannister
Your queen will execute you for this.,jaime lannister
"If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible.",tyrion lannister
"Tens of thousands of innocent lives one not particularly innocent dwarf it seems like a fair trade. If it weren't for you, I never wouldo ve survived my childhood.",tyrion lannister
You would have.,jaime lannister
You were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster. You were all I had.,tyrion lannister
"If you hear the bells ring, they've surrendered. Call off your men.",tyrion lannister
Soldier!,jaime lannister
All we need is one good shot.,cersei lannister
The Iron Fleet hold Blackwater Bay. Euron killed one of her dragons. He can kill another.,cersei lannister
Our men will fight harder than sellswords ever could. They will defend their queen to the last man.,cersei lannister
The Red Keep has never fallen. It won't fall today.,cersei lannister
"Move, move!",jon snow
No! Get back! Get back!,jon snow
Stay! Stay!,jon snow
Quickly. Quickly.,davos
Stop!,jon snow
Find somewhere to hide.,jon snow
We need to get the queen out of King's Landing.,jaime lannister
"Well, maybe for you.",jaime lannister
You're no king.,jaime lannister
The Red Keep is the safest place in the city.,cersei lannister
I'm going to kill her.,arya stark
Sandor.,arya stark
Thank you.,arya stark
"Ser Gregor, stay by my side.",cersei lannister
"Ser Gregor, I command you.",cersei lannister
You're hurt.,cersei lannister
It doesn't matter.,jaime lannister
You're bleeding.,cersei lannister
Let go.,arya stark
Wait! Wait! No!,arya stark
We need to fall back! Fall back behind the wall! Fall back!,jon snow
Get out of the city! Fall back! Fall back! Fall back!,jon snow
You can't stay here. You have to keep moving.,arya stark
You have to.,arya stark
"If you stay here, you'll die. Follow me.",arya stark
Follow me!,arya stark
Get up. Get up!,arya stark
We have to keep moving.,arya stark
Come on! Come on!,arya stark
This way.,jaime lannister
I want our baby to live. I want our baby to live. I want our baby to live.,cersei lannister
"Don't let me die, Jaime. Please don't let me die.",cersei lannister
It's all right.,jaime lannister
Please don't let me die.,cersei lannister
I don't want to die.,cersei lannister
Just look- Look at me. Look at me.,jaime lannister
Not like this. Not like this. Not like this.,cersei lannister
Look- Look- Look me in the eye. Don't look away. Don't look- Look at me! Just look at me.,jaime lannister
Nothing else matters. Nothing else matters. Only us.,jaime lannister
I'll find you later.,tyrion lannister
It's not safe. Let me send some men with you.,jon snow
I'm going alone.,tyrion lannister
Grey Worm!,jon snow
It's over.,jon snow
How much more defeated do you want them to be? They're on their knees.,davos
"Look around you, friend. We won.",davos
And what are the queen's commands?,jon snow
"Easy, men. Easy! Easy.",davos
Jon. We should speak with the queen.,davos
Blood of my blood.,daenerys targaryen
You kept all your promises to me. You killed my enemies in their iron suits.,daenerys targaryen
Your tore down their stone houses. You gave me the Seven Kingdoms.,daenerys targaryen
Torgo Nudho.,daenerys targaryen
"You have walked beside me since the Plaza of Pride. You are the bravest of men, the most loyal of soldiers. I name you commander of all my forces, the Queen's Master of War.",daenerys targaryen
Unsullied. All of you were torn from your mother's arms and raised as slaves. Now you are liberators. You have freed the people of King's Landing from the grip of a tyrant!,daenerys targaryen
But the war is not over. We will not lay down our spears until we have liberated all the people of the world!,daenerys targaryen
"From Winterfell to Dorne, from Lannisport to Qarth, from the Summer Isles to the Jade Sea! Women, men and children have suffered too long beneath the wheel.",daenerys targaryen
Will you break the wheel with me?,daenerys targaryen
You freed your brother. You committed treason.,daenerys targaryen
I freed my brother. And you slaughtered a city.,tyrion lannister
Take him.,daenerys targaryen
What are you doing here?,jon snow
"Hey, what happened?",jon snow
I came to kill Cersei. Your queen got there first.,arya stark
She's everyone's queen now.,jon snow
Try telling Sansa.,arya stark
Wait for me outside the city gates. I'll come find you.,jon snow
Jon. She knows who you are. Who you really are. You'll always be a threat to her. And I know a killer when I see one.,arya stark
Did you bring any wine?,tyrion lannister
No.,jon snow
"Ah... Well... thank you for coming to see me. Our queen doesn't keep prisoners for long. I suppose there's a crude kind of justice. I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn. Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes, ""See, I told you."" It just occurred to me. I'm talking to the only man alive who knows where I'm going.",tyrion lannister
So is there life after death?,tyrion lannister
Not that I've seen.,jon snow
I should be thankful. Oblivion is the best I could hope for. I strangled my lover. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I betrayed my queen.,tyrion lannister
You didn't.,jon snow
"I did. And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen. I chose my fate. The people of King's Landing did not.",tyrion lannister
I can't justify what happened. I won't try. But the war is over now.,jon snow
"Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting?",tyrion lannister
She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She liberated the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.,tyrion lannister
"And you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today.",jon snow
Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood.,tyrion lannister
"You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister.",jon snow
"My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day.",tyrion lannister
Cersei left her no choice.,jon snow
"The moment the gates fell, the battle was over.",tyrion lannister
She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.,jon snow
And she burned down a city for it.,tyrion lannister
"Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield.",jon snow
Would you have done it?,tyrion lannister
What?,jon snow
"You've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down?",tyrion lannister
I don't know.,jon snow
"Yes, you do. You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know.",tyrion lannister
What's it matter what I'd do?,jon snow
"It matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I'm sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men.",tyrion lannister
"When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?",tyrion lannister
I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother.,tyrion lannister
Love is the death of duty.,jon snow
You just came up with that?,tyrion lannister
Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.,jon snow
"Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?",tyrion lannister
It's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?,tyrion lannister
That's her decision. She is the queen.,jon snow
I'm sorry it came to this.,jon snow
And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?,tyrion lannister
My sisters will be loyal to the throne.,jon snow
Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.,tyrion lannister
She doesn't get to choose.,jon snow
No. But you do. And you have to choose now.,tyrion lannister
"When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with a thousand swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do a thousand swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to twenty? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet.",daenerys targaryen
I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders.,jon snow
It was necessary.,daenerys targaryen
"Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned!",jon snow
I tried to make peace with Cersei. She used their innocence as a weapon against me. She thought it would cripple me.,daenerys targaryen
And Tyrion?,jon snow
"He conspired behind my back with my enemies. How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?",daenerys targaryen
Forgive him.,jon snow
I can't.,daenerys targaryen
"You can. You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake. Make them understand.",jon snow
"Please, Dany.",jon snow
We can't hide behind small mercies. The world we need won't be built by men loyal to the world we have.,daenerys targaryen
The world we need is a world of mercy. It has to be.,jon snow
And it will be. It's not easy to see something that's never been before. A good world.,daenerys targaryen
How do you know? How do you know it'll be good?,jon snow
Because I know what is good. And so do you.,daenerys targaryen
I don't.,jon snow
You do. You do. You've always known.,daenerys targaryen
What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good.,jon snow
They don't get to choose.,daenerys targaryen
"Be with me. Build the new world with me. This is our reason. It has been from the beginning, since you were a little boy with a bastardo s name and I was a little girl who couldn't count to twenty. We do it together. We break the wheel together.",daenerys targaryen
"You are my queen. Now, and always.",jon snow
Where's Jon?,sansa stark
So is Lord Tyrion. They were both to be brought to this gathering.,sansa stark
"If you look outside the walls of your city, you'll find thousands of Northmen who will explain to you why harming Jon Snow is not in your interest.",sansa stark
You swore to follow a tyrant.,sansa stark
Say another word about killing my brother and I'll cut your throat.,arya stark
"Friends, please. We've been cutting each other's throats long enough. Torgo Nudho. Am I saying that properly?",davos
"If it weren't for you and your men, we wouldo ve lost the war with the dead. This country owes you a debt it can never repay, but let us try. There is land in the Reach. Good land. The people that used to live there are gone. Make it your own. Start your own house with the Unsullied as your bannermen. We've had enough war. Thousands of you, thousands of them. You know how it ends. We need to find a better way.",davos
It's not for you to decide.,tyrion lannister
You're right. And no one's any better for it. But it's not for you to decide. Jon committed his crime here. His fate is for our king to decide. Or our queen.,tyrion lannister
You're the most powerful people in Westeros. Choose one.,tyrion lannister
Uncle? Please sit.,sansa stark
Why just us?,sam
"Um- We represent all the great houses, but whomever we choose, they won't just rule over lords and ladies. Maybe the decision about what's best for everyone should be left to well, everyone.",sam
Me? The Imp?,tyrion lannister
"Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her.",tyrion lannister
Can't think of a worse choice.,tyrion lannister
"Who, then?",davos
I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. About our bloody history. About the mistakes we've made.,tyrion lannister
"What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. Our triumphs... mm, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future?",tyrion lannister
Bran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children.,sansa stark
"Good. Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know. His will never torment us. That is the wheel our queen wanted to break.",tyrion lannister
"From now on, rulers will not be born. They will be chosen on this spot by the lords and ladies of Westeros to serve the realm.",tyrion lannister
"I know you don't want it. I know you don't care about power. But I ask you now, if we choose you will you wear the crown? Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms to the best of your abilities from this day until your last day?",tyrion lannister
To Brandon of House Stark... I say aye.,tyrion lannister
Aye.,sam
"I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye.",davos
Aye.,brienne
"I love you, little brother. I always will. You'll be a good king. But tens of thousands of Northmen fell in the Great War defending all of Westeros. And those who survived have seen too much and fought too hard ever to kneel again. The North will remain an independent kingdom, as it was for thousands of years.",sansa stark
"All hail Bran the Broken, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.",tyrion lannister
"N- No, Your Grace, I don't want it.",tyrion lannister
"I don't deserve it. I thought I was wise, but I wasn't. I thought I knew what was right, but I didn't. Choose Ser Davos. Choose anyone else.",tyrion lannister
Giving you to the Unsullied would start a war. Letting you walk free would start a war. So our new king has chosen to send you to the Night's Watch.,tyrion lannister
There's still a Night's Watch?,jon snow
The world will always need a home for bastards and broken men.,tyrion lannister
"You shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. The Unsullied wanted your head of course, but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence. Sansa and Arya wanted you freed, but they understand our new king needs to make peace. No one is very happy. Which means it's a good compromise, I suppose.",tyrion lannister
Was it right? What I did?,jon snow
What we did.,tyrion lannister
It doesn't feel right.,jon snow
Ask me again in ten years.,tyrion lannister
I don't expect we'll ever see each other again.,jon snow
I wouldn't be so sure. A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world.,tyrion lannister
I wish there had been another way. Can you forgive me?,sansa stark
"The North is free, thanks to you.",jon snow
But they lost their king.,sansa stark
Ned Stark's daughter will speak for them. She's the best they could ask for.,jon snow
"You can come see me, you know, at Castle Black.",jon snow
I can't.,arya stark
You think anyone will dare tell you women aren't allowed?,jon snow
I'm not going back north.,arya stark
Where are you going?,sansa stark
What's west of Westeros?,arya stark
No one knows. It's where all the maps stop. That's where I'm going.,arya stark
You have your Needle?,jon snow
Right here.,arya stark
Your Grace.,jon snow
I'm sorry I wasn't there when you needed me.,jon snow
That's not- Uh-,tyrion lannister
What's this?,tyrion lannister
A Song of Ice and Fire. Archmaester Ebrose's history of the wars following the death of King Robert. I helped him with the title.,sam
I suppose I come in for some heavy criticism.,tyrion lannister
"Oh, I wouldn't say that.",sam
"Oh, he's kind to me. Never wouldo ve guessed.",tyrion lannister
He's not kind?,tyrion lannister
He-,sam
He what? What does he say about me?,tyrion lannister
"I don't believe you're mentioned, ahem.",sam
Your Grace.,tyrion lannister
Your Grace.,davos
Your Grace.,bronn
Your Grace.,sam
"Yes, Your Grace. Suitable prospects will be brought to you for an audience in the coming weeks.",tyrion lannister
"He was last spotted flying east, toward-",sam
"The farther away, the better.",bronn
"As you wish, Your Grace.",tyrion lannister
Ser Podrick.,brienne
"We serve at your pleasure, King Bran the Broken, ruler of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. Long may he reign.",tyrion lannister
Long may he reign.,sam
Long may he reign.,davos
Long may he reign.,brienne
Long may he reign.,bronn
That will improve.,tyrion lannister
"Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of Coin, would you say the crown's debt to you has been paid?",tyrion lannister
"In full, my lord Hand.",bronn
Good. Time to start incurring a new one. We have hungry people to feed. Can we expect some assistance in this regard?,tyrion lannister
Indeed we can.,bronn
"Lord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair.",tyrion lannister
We have. These projects will begin as soon as the Master of Coin and Lord of Lofty Titles provides funding.,davos
"The Master of Coin looks forward to helping the Master of Ships, but first he has to ensure we're not wasting coin, or soon there won't be no more coin.",bronn
Any more.,davos
You Master of Grammar now too?,bronn
"Grandmaester, ahem, it is my theory, based on my years of work on the Casterly Rock sewers, that clean water leads to a healthier population.",tyrion lannister
The Archmaester has done some research on this subject and it turns out-,sam
The strong live and the weak don't.,bronn
Find the best builders and set them to the task.,tyrion lannister
"Oh, speaking of builders, all the best brothels burned down. The Master of Coin is willing to fund reconstruction.",bronn
Uh... the Archmaester is less than enthusiastic about the salutary effects of brothels.,sam
"Well, I imagine he isn't using them properly.",bronn
I think we can all agree that ships take precedence over brothels.,brienne
I think that's a very presumptuous statement.,bronn
I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel.,tyrion lannister
