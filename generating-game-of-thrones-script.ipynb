    "Case that most likely occured on column `Sentence` is not as much as in `Name` column. One of the reason is because we already clean some of them on `Name` cleansing process.\n",
    "\n",
    "However there are still cases that make our the `Sentence` column still contains dirty data. First case is the sentence is not properly started meaning that first character on the sentence is a non-aphanumeric character. This can happen because of our previous cleansing in which we remove the bracketed text on our `Name` and `Sentence` columns. Next case is the sentence written in differen format than most of them, or to be specific some sentences are written inside quote `''` or double quote `\"\"`, while others are not. The last case is sentences that contain empty string which might also happen because of removing of the bracketed texts.\n",

    "Scrapping web to extract the data scattered around them may take a lot of effort. We need to do bunch of manual inspect element just to get the exact position of data or information that we want to collect from all over the html parts. BeautifulSoup functionality is good, but for case like this we need to combine this package with manual inspect element to produce the desired result faster. Some of you might have different and even a better solution on extracting data from online sources, and that is a great thing. As for me, I am still learning and experimenting different methodologies to find my best practice on doing so.\n",
