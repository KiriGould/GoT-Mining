Sentence
She didn't forget. She's with her dancing master.
What is it? What's happening?
"You said right, but you went left."
Only 'cause you lied.
"I was so. I watched, but you..."
My father wouldn't send you.
And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
Come with me. Run.
Not today.
Not today. Not today.
Stay away from me.
Needle.
What do you want?
Leave me be. My father's a lord. He'll reward you.
Stay away!
"Just these two, My Lord. Been dead awhile, I'd say."
We should burn them.
Is there any word of my father?
My sisters were in King's Landing too.
He wouldn't do that. He knows how much I love Joffrey.
"Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong."
"No, I'm not."
"The girl is innocent, Your Grace."
"Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest."
Robb.
"Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt."
"If...if I could see my father, talk to him about..."
"You disappoint me, child."
I only meant that...what will happen to him?
That depends.
On...on what?
On your brother. And on you.
Treason? Sansa wrote this?
"Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?"
"I won't refuse. His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing."
You will not support us then? Do I understand you correctly?
That is what I ask.
If you fear for the safety of your son...
And that is why we have to stop them.
From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
"And feed it to the goats, yes."
Uncle. Father.
The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
Sorry to disappoint you.
And who are these Companions of yours?
"This is Shagga Son of Dolf, Chieftain of the Stone Crows."
You wouldn't know him.
"May I present My Lord Father, Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister."
You left us no choice. The honor of the House was at stake.
"We have our differences, Jaime and I."
He's been covering himself in glory.
And the Starks? Lord Eddard?
Is our hostage.
How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?
Robert Baratheon is dead.
"My sister rules, you mean."
A green boy.
Maybe. Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.
It is said that the men of the Mountain clans are great warriors.
To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at The Twins.
Lord Frey controls that bridge.
"The late Lord Frey"" my father calls him."
Robb's right.
Where did you find him?
How high did you get?
"My father understands mercy, when there is room for it."
Robb.
"Tell Lord Tywin, Winter is coming for him."
You call me boy again.
Go on.
Ser Aron.
Lord Gyles.
Ser Barristan Selmy.
"Rise, Ser Barristan."
"Whose death, Ser Barristan? Yours or your King's?"
The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
"Careful, Ser."
"A naked Knight, apparently."
Your Grace.
"Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?"
I do.
"As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father, Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King."
"Thank you, Your Grace."
Do you deny your father's crime?
"No, My Lords. I know he must be punished."
He was badly hurt.
"If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace."
He will.
Envy isn't attractive.
You should be proud of your brother's achievement. I took the great castle of Winterfell with twenty men.
"I treated the Stark boys with honor, and they repaid me with treachery."
Before I had to kill them- I treated them-
Exactly.
They made me a promise
Don't call me
"If I hadn't killed them, the Northerners would think me weak."
I'm warning you.
You haven't brought enough men. How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot?
Is this a joke? Winterfell is the heart of the North.
He won't find out. We've killed all the ravens. We have all the horses. I've taken Winterfell. And I will keep Winterfell.
I don't intend to die.
"I couldn't do it. I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't-"
The others?
They died because of me.
I've never met her.
"Frey, I suppose. I don't know her first name."
An important bridge.
"It was before they killed my father. I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time, but only if I crossed that bridge."
"He was the best man I ever met. I know children always think that about their fathers, but"
"He once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them. The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect. The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect. The soldiers you order into battle. He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night. I didn't believe him. I asked him, ""How can a man be brave if he's afraid?"" ""That is the only time a man can be brave,"" he told me."
He would have liked you.
He didn't care much about gold or glory.
Because we'll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated. And because I believe in justice.
That would be a start.
How? How?
Tell me this isn't true.
Why?
For the girls.
You betrayed me.
Robb-
No! You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway.
"Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell. Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing. I have five children, and only one of them is free."
"I grieve for your sons, my lord."
"Killing Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children, but returning him to King's Landing may buy life for mine."
Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool. You've weakened our position. You've brought discord into our camp. And you did it all behind my back. Make sure she's guarded day and night.
Robb. How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer?
Send another forty with our fastest horses.
Robb.
Damn.
"You're much uglier in daylight. What's your name? I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin."
A captive knight has a right to know his captor's identity.
Brienne of Tarth.
"Tarth, Tarth, Tarth. Crescent moons and starbursts. Lord Selwyn Tarth. Your father. Do you have any brothers and sisters, my lady? It's a long way to King's Landing. Might as well get to know one another."
Have you known many men? I suppose not. Women? Horses? Ah.
"I didn't mean to give offense, my lady. Forgive me."
"Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer."
Why do you hate me so much? Have I ever harmed you?
"You've harmed others, those you were sworn to protect, the weak, the innocent."
Has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly?
You will not provoke me to anger.
I already have. Look at you. You're ready to chop my head off. Do you think you could? Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight?
I've never seen you fight.
The answer is no. There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me. You're not one of them.
All my life men like you have sneered at me. And all my life I've been knocking men like you into the dust.
"If you're so confident, unlock my chains. Let's see what happens."
Do you take me for an idiot? In!
"I took you for a fighter, a man Pardon. Woman of honor. Was I wrong? You're afraid."
"Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer."
Surrender the Iron Throne?
"No, a king who runs will not be king for long. He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight. Stannis, two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep."
"Ha! The last time the scouts assured us of Stark's movement, he lured us into a trap. Which is why my son is his prisoner."
Too close to Casterly Rock.
He's a boy and he's never lost a battle. He'll risk anything at any time because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.
"We'll ride at nightfall. I want a full night's march before he knows we're on the move. Clegane, you'll maintain a garrison here at Harrenhal. Track down this brotherhood and destroy them. The girl has proven herself a good servant. She'll stay on with you. See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings. He's poor company when he's sober, but he's better at his work."
Where's Jaqen?
I need him now. Lord Tywin's marching tonight.
He's helping me.
Where?
They'll never trust me.
What?
I didn't.
Do you have to do that here?
I like to keep me hands clean.
"Yes, but do you have to do it here?"
You should start wearing the gold cloak.
I don't want to wear a gold cloak.
You're commander of the City Watch. You shouldn't be dressed like a common
"A cloak slows you down in a fight. Makes it hard to move quietly. And the gold catches the light, so you're nice and easy to spot at night."
"Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer. You're supposed to stand out."
We had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.
"Fine, fine. No gold cloak."
What?
What?
What? What? Why are you staring at me?
You don't want me cleaning me nails. You don't want me looking your way. Why am I here?
To help me plan the defense of King's Landing.
Stannis will be here any day.
And one of these explains how to beat him?
"An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros. "" By Archmaester Shevelathin. Shevelatesh."
Chevalteesh. I'd swap all your books for a few good archers.
My Lord Hand. Commander. I must compliment you on the gold cloaks' performance these last few weeks. Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery?
I did not know. And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?
Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves.
For questioning?
No. It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.
We talked about this.
"Aye, we talked about it. Have you ever been in a city under siege? Maybe this part's not in your books. See, it's not the fighting that kills most people. It's the starving. Foodo s worth more than gold. Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes. Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other."
"The thieves, they love a siege. Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food. By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town."
"Given the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted."
"Ah. ""The Great Sieges of Westeros."" Thrilling subject. Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan wasn't a better writer."
"Stannis knows King's Landing. He knows where the walls are strongest, and he knows which gates are weakest. The Mud Gate. A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and it's only 50 yards from the water. That's where he'll land."
"And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan?"
We could throw books at his men.
We don't have that many books.
"We don't have that many men, either."
What do we have?
Pig shit.
I'm not cut out for this sort of work.
Where do you think Jon is right now?
"He's not dead. No, Jon's a great fighter."
He's got a Valyrian steel sword.
And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.
The First Men made these marks. Help me with it.
That's a Night's Watch cloak.
Oh. Must be dragonglass.
The maesters call it obsidian.
I'm sorry. I'll-
Where were you?
"Tywin Lannister was right here, and now he's gone."
How long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone?
He's taking his army to attack my brother. I need him dead right now.
You promised you'd help me.
And you'll kill them? Anybody?
All right. Jaqen H'ghar.
That's right.
I'm not joking. A man can go kill himself.
No.
I'll un-name you.
If you help me and my friends escape.
"Fine, Jaqen H'ghar."
A girl will obey.
"Thank you, Podrick."
Odd little boy.
I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.
You and Varys both.
Excellent lamprey pie. Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting. An inspiration for the troops. The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.
He's only a boy.
Younger boys are off fighting his war.
He's not ready.
"What is he, seventeen? Remember Jaime at seventeen?"
"Better than you. Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't. His place is not on the battlefield."
"It's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us."
Do you think I'm an idiot?
"No, I'd say you possess above-average intelligence."
You shipped off my only daughter. And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die.
He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Any dessert?
Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?
Because he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it.
Because he doesn't have a cock.
Neither do you.
"Perhaps I'm dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking."
It's not that little.
Why are you smiling?
Because I'm happy.
And why are you happy?
Because I have your little whore.
I thought you preferred blondes.
"Such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good. Father will be so pleased."
Why do you care who I fuck?
"Because a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed."
This is madness. Stannis will be here in days. You need me.
"For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore. Lovely body. The bruises will heal in time."
Where did you find her?
"Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully."
You've forgotten the most important thing about whores.
"Oh? Well, you're the expert. Tell me."
"You don't buy them, you only rent them."
"You're usually a better liar, baby brother. This one you like. You like her very much. Could it be love? Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough. Unless Joffrey is hurt. And then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer, too. And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt."
And how do I know you haven't killed her already?
"Would you like to see her? I thought you might. Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore."
I'm sorry they hurt you. You must be brave.
I promise I will free you.
Never.
"I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you're safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid."
Get out.
Shae!
You're beautiful.
We have to be more careful.
There are people who want to hurt me.
I would kill for you. Do you know that? I expect I'll have to before this is over. You're mine.
Promise me.
Still no word?
Theon has my brothers. If we storm the castle
Send word to your son. Any Ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes.
Any Ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy. He betrayed our cause. He betrayed me. And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs.
How am I? I've had to arrest my mother. The Lannisters have my sisters. The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers. I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north.
No. Forgive me. You're being kind. I have no right.
That's not the kind of king I want to be.
I don't know. The good kind. Most kings grew up as princes. They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown. I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.
I'd like to hear you play the harp.
How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men's feet?
I don't want to marry the Frey girl.
Shut up. What did you bring?
"He didn't say. He just said, ""Walk through the gates."""
He didn't say anything about the guards.
We have to trust him.
Shut up. Stay here if you're afraid.
"If the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day."
Will it hold?
"Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace."
"I admire you, Ser Davos."
"I thank you, Your Grace."
"Pleased to hear it. Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you. So you take the onion for your sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag."
"My son wishes me to change it. Three mermen with tridents, something like that. I understand why the older families look down at me."
Do you? Why?
My father was a crabber.
And?
"Well, sons of lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers. Our hands stink."
And where were those lords when Storm's End starved?
Many fought bravely for your brother. Many fought for the Mad King.
You defend these men who insult you behind your back.
Some are happy to do it to my face.
"We were forgotten. Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes. The glorious rebels marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King, while I held Storm's End with five hundred men."
"No one has forgotten, Your Grace."
No? Robert did. He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war. Renly never fought a day in his life.
He was only a boy.
Then why'd he give him Storm's End?
"First, we ate the horses. We weren't riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine. I do like dogs. Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them. Then the rats. The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying. She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail. And then you made it through the lines. Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions."
"And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe."
Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.
I was relieved they did not.
"Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it. Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up. Insult or no, I gave it up. Because Robert was my older brother, and he was the king and I've always done my duty. But now, I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros. And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand."
"Your Grace, I pray I serve you well."
I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge.
"No man can be in all rooms at all times. I have many little birds in the North, my lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell."
"To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?"
"A brave choice, Your Grace. I'm sure your men will line up behind you."
Imagine Stannis' terror.
I am trying.
You're an intelligent man. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.
"Oh, no one disputes that, my lord, not even the multitudes who despise you."
"I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men."
"I wish we could, too."
What do you want? Tell me.
"If we're going to play, you'll have to start."
"My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history. My sister became queen at the age of nineteen. When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock."
A most highborn plumber.
The water never flowed better. And all the shit found its way to the sea. I never expected to have any real power. So when my father named me acting Hand
"You're quite good at being Hand, you know? Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men. Honorable men. But they disdained the game and those who played. You enjoy the game."
I do. Last thing I expected.
And you play it well.
"I'd like to keep playing it. If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over."
They say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light.
"The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?"
"In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with sixteen teats."
We should sail there immediately.
"This morning, I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste. Daenerys Targaryen lives."
A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.
"She has three dragons. But even if what they say is true, it'll be years before they are fully grown. And then there will be nowhere to hide."
"One game at a time, my friend."
"Careful, Khaleesi. Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have a thousand eyes watching for you. I found one. A ship with a good captain. She leaves for Astapor tomorrow."
Astapor?
We cannot stay here.
They have my dragons. A mother does not flee without her children.
"They're not your children. I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them, but you didn't grow them in your womb. They didn't suckle at your breast. They are dragons, Khaleesi. And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die."
You should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there.
"You know I would die for you. I will never abandon you. I'm sworn to protect you, to serve."
"Then serve me. If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there."
"That's what the warlock wants. He told you so himself. If you enter that place, you will never leave again. His magic is strong."
And what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire. You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me? Do you remember?
"Until my last breath, I will remember. After I have forgotten my mother's face."
They are my children. And they are the only children I will ever have. Take me to them.
We should bury them.
"If they haven't got the damn message yet, a few more days won't help. As you say. But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer."
Gold for the farmer. For his trouble.
There's no one worse than you.
You're lying.
Is that the Blackwater?
Back to King's Landing to Joffrey and the queen.
But why?
Why would they be at the Twins?
They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid. The Yunkish are paying them well.
You know these men?
"Only by the broken swords on their banners. They're called the Second Sons. A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, ""The Titan's Bastard."""
Is he more titan or bastard?
"He's a dangerous man, khaleesi. They all are."
How many?
Enough to make a difference?
It's hard to collect wages from a corpse. I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.
I imagine you're right.
I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.
He may not agree to meet.
He will. A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.
Mind your tongue.
We have no slaves here.
"Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded. Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?"
"We have more, don't we?"
"I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us."
You're very young to be a captain.
"Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds don't favor your side."
The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.
Or you could fight for me.
I would pay you as much and more.
Ride with me and you'll never need another contract. You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.
"A fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons. You have two days to decide."
These men are our guests. You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder.
"A barrel, then."
"Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first."
"Half Robert, half lowborn."
What do you mean to do with him?
"Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes? If it needs to be done, do it. Don't torture the boy."
No.
You've slaughtered many lambs?
"And tho- and thowg V-v-visenya Targaryen rod- rode Vhagar- Vhag-' Fuck me. 'Visenya Targaryen rode Vhagar, the smallest of the dragons, though still large enog- enough- enough to swallow a horse whole."
Your Grace.
They feeding you enough?
"Two meals a day. Cold for breakfast, hot for supper. I cannot complain."
You don't belong in a place like this.
"Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse."
Yeah.
I'm sorry about your son. Didn't get the chance to tell you before. Good lad. Loyal lad.
Melisandre's returned.
I didn't know she'd been gone.
Came back with a bastard boy. Robert's bastard boy.
Why?
She says there's power in king's blood.
She's going to kill him.
Sacrifice him.
"Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice? The boy is your nephew."
What of it? We're at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?
Because he has your blood in his veins.
So did Renly.
"Renly wronged you. Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you. He raised an army, stole your bannermen. This boy has done you no harm. He's an innocent."
"How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women?The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. Unless I triumph. I never asked for this. No more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty. What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?"
"Your Grace, why did you come to see me today?"
I came to free you. If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.
I swear it. I can't swear never to speak against her.
You have little regard for your own life.
"Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I'd counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself. You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory. When my son was five he said to me, 'I don't ever want to die. ' I wanted to say to him, 'You won't, child. You won't ever.' I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid. I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night."
"I saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?"
Lady Sansa.
"You look very handsome, my lord."
"Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden?"
"My lady, I want you to know I didn't ask for this."
"I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord."
"No, don't. You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore. You won't be a prisoner after today. You'll be my wife. I suppose that's a different kind of prison. I just wanted to say- I'm just trying to say, very badly- I just- just want to say I know how you feel."
"I doubt that very much, my lord."
You're right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel.
"But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you. Do you drink wine?"
When I have to.
"Well, today you have to."
Radiant? Why radiant?
"You're a musical girl, aren't you? I imagine you have a lovely voice."
"Ah, but you know the song 'The Rains of Castamere'?"
So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?
House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?
"Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now?"
"Gone. A gentle word. Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword."
"I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. 'And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear.'"
"If you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep."
What are you doing?
Could you-
Thank you.
The usurper Robb Stark. The usurper Balon Greyjoy. The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
"So their son will be your nephew. After you're wed to Cersei, of course. And you will be the king's stepfather and brother-in-law. When you marry the king, Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law and your son will be Loras' nephew? Grandson? I'm not sure. But your brother will become your father-in-law. That much is beyond dispute."
"Will you pardon me, my lord?"
Of course. Of course. En-enjoy.
Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead.
Stay.
You seem rather drunk.
Rather less than I plan to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?
"This isn't about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible."
And?
"If you're going to give her one, you need to perform."
What did you once call me? A drunken little lust-filled beast.
More than once.
"There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit."
"You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty."
Nobody cares what your father once told you.
"Thank you, Your Grace."
"Yes, Your Grace."
There will be no bedding ceremony.
Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.
"I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace. I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king."
"A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won't even know I'm there."
"Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace."
I am. Guilty. But- but it is my wedding night.
"My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife."
"I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree? Come, I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood."
"Is that wise, my lord?"
"Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion."
"Is that wise, Tyrion?"
Nothing was ever wiser.
Astoundingly long.
What?
Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly?
Fourteen.
"Well, talk won't make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage."
"Stop. I can't. I could, I won't."
But your father-
"If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to."
What if I never want you to?
And so my watch begins.
Ninteen
How can anyone speak nineteen languages?
"Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope- what do you mean reasonably well?"
Drogo said I spoke Dothroaki like one born to it. It gave him great pride.
Athjahaka.
Athjahakar.
"Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice."
What do you want?
Let her go.
You were sent here to kill me?
So why haven't you?
What do your captains have to say about that?
Why?
Over what?
You're a strange man.
And this is supposed to impress me?
Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?
Will you fight for me?
Swear to me.
You really ought to knock.
It's getting dark. We could stay here for the night.
How hard can it be to build a fire?
He winked at me before.
I saw him wink at me.
I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink.
"Well, I mean, there's no real difference."
You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.
What? No. This is just the way I talk.
Don't you think he should have a name?
"Let's see, there's Duncan, Kevan, Jo,n Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer."
"Uh, yes. Maybe that's not-"
"That's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name."
"Well, it's a family name. For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly. Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name. You see? So my father is also a Tarly."
"No, Randyll Tarly."
Please don't name him Randyll.
Different manner of cruel.
I'll be back. I just want to look.
Go inside. Go back inside. I'll-
Stay back!
You stay back!
I should never have left her there.
You couldn't have known.
Of course I couldo ve known. They were raiding the villages close by.
She's dead because of me.
"We can't go after them, you know that. That's what they want."
Little Same. As if I'd cut their throats myself.
She might have.
"If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next. Mance's army must be close."
You think he was spying on you?
The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body. They make love under the stars for the whole Khalasar to see.
But you are not Dothraki.
"Well, I don't see why it matters. Grey worm isn't interested, none of the unsullied care what's under our clothes."
What?
"When the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it?"
The...the pillar an the stones.
Haven't you ever wondered?
"I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands."
I'm Reek.
Always. Forever.
Yes.
I was born on Pike to Balon Greyjoy. His third and last-living son. I am your prince. I swear it by the drowned god. What is dead may never die.
Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell. He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow Ironborn.
You are fading from sickness. You are badly outnumbered and you're hundreds of miles from the sea. Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold. Do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me. The Boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore.
"My own father, your king, surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon. I watched him bend the knee. There was no shame there. He fought with honor, as did you."
"I'm sorry, I didn't hear..."
scared* You don't know.
whispering* Reek. Reek.
Reek.
Yes. Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates. You're going home.
Yes m'lord. Will we go home now?
He can stay.
"to Petyr* I'm sorry, Lord Baelish. I have to tell the truth. *to the council* I'll tell you everything."
"My name is not Alayne. It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark. Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell. You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall."
"Lord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing...except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale. He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name."
"You knew her well, my lords, my lady. You knew she was a troubled woman. She always loved Lord Baelish. She told me herself. From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack. She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn. She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have. When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy. For a time. My aunt was a jealous lady. She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore. That he would abandon her for a younger woman. And then...one day she saw him kiss me."
"It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more. Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage. He's always been so kind to me. I was so happy to be here, to be free. All because of him. But my aunt turned on me. She cursed me. Called me a whore. Promised to throw me through the Moon Door. When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him. She said she didn't want to live anymore. She stood on the edge of that Moon Door. He tried to reason with her. Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was...*begins sobbing*"
Why did the usurper pardon you?
"No, speak to me here. Explain it to me."
The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged.
"Why, then?"
What was the content of these letters?
What information?
You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?
Yes or no?
Don't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?
That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.
Because you knew it was poisoned.
You betrayed me from the first.
You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother's throne...
and you want me to forgive you?
"Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed. But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive. Go back to your masters in King's Landing. Collect your pardon if you can."
"Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name. You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city. If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay. Go. Now."
Yes?
They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.
"If they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me?"
Neither do I.
I know what you want.
Lots of things make me happy.
"Killing Polliver, killing Rorge."
At least I could have been there to watch. I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.
You protected him for most of his life. You think you could have saved him?
That's your stupid pride talking. It's why you'll never be a great killer. I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.
You should have let me burn it.
That fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to.
You really think my aunt will pay for me?
I've never even met her.
I'm not a lady.
Shall we go?
Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?
Soon.
"Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?"
I've never seen him fight.
"Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die."
Oberyn believes in himself.
That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?
Beheading.
"Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word."
Cousins.
"Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?"
Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.
Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.
Nothing made him happier.
Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.
On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.
"The joke wore thin, though."
For you. You drifted away.
I had other interests.
"Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson."
Why?
"I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. ""Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?"" He gave me an answer. ""Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!"" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library."
Volarik. Tried to touch me once.
"Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of ""khuu, khuu, khuu"". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard ""khuu, khuu, khuu"" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason."
"Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?"
"I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once."
He was twice your size.
"He just pushed me aside with a ""khuu"" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?"
I don't know.
Good luck today.
Looks like very light armor.
You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight.
It could get you killed. It could get me killed.
Thank the gods.
"standing up* The gods have made their will known. Tyrion Lannister, in the name of King Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, you are hereby sentenced to death."
"Your Grace, I want to say--"
You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are?
If only I were otherwise.
If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn't I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine
You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.
So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?
Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It's too soon to know if you deserve my service.
If you'd rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.
"When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least."
And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?
Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.
I have a very large army and very large dragons.
Killing and politics aren't always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.
So you want to advise me. Very well. What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.
I know.
Why should the people trust a queen who can't keep her promises?
"Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can't remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you."
Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?
"Yes, many opportunities."
And did he?
No. Not until forced to do so.
"He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him."
So I should kill him?
"A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you're going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you're ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do."
Remove Ser Jorah from the city.
My son. Let me speak to--
My face will be the last thing you see before--
"My name is Lana. I'm an orphan. When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters, and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more."
"Iit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart. Now every morning I make my way down to the canals. I pass the fish mongers and the bakers. I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on my way home. Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--"
"Left onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade."
How will she serve him?
What will she do there?
See what?
"Oysters, clams and cockles!"
Oysters clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles!
Best in the city.
So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?
"If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money."
The Many Faced God. You said you didn't know what I would see at the docks.
And then what?
The charges?
All lies.
I wish you'd said it sooner. Any word from Jaime?
Tell him I need to speak to him.
"What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king--"
"You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother."
I can't stay here.
"Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won't. I made him. I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness."
Why. Why Theon.
Not Theon. There is no Theon. Reek.
"Reek. Why did you tell him, Reek?"
"I was helping you. You were trying to escape, there is no escape. Not ever. Theon Greyjoy tried to escape. The master knew. He knows everything. He hunted him, he caught him, he strapped him to a cross, and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left."
"Good. If it weren't for you I'd still have a family. If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would."
I deserved everything. I deserve to be Reek. I did terrible things. Turned on Robb. Captured Winterfell. Killed those boys.
"They weren't “those boys”, they were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers, you'd know them since they were born."
They weren't. They were only--
Only what?
I can't..
Tell me!
"I can't, not unless the master says..."
"Tell me, they weren't what?!"
They weren't...
"Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be dead while you still breathe the air. Tell me to my face Theon, tell me that they weren't your brothers!"
They weren't Bran and Rickon! I couldn't find them. It was two farm boys. I killed them and burned them so no one would know.
You didn't…?
"Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?"
I can't talk to you anymore.
"Theon, you have to tell me, do you have any idea where Bran and Rickon--"
"Not Theon, Reek!"
So have you decided yet? Whether I'm worthy of your service?
Have you decided yet whether you're going to have me killed?
It's probably my safest option.
I can see why you would think so. It's what your father would have done.
And what would your father do?
My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.
Is that why you killed him?
"Some day if you decide not to execute me, I'll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we'll need more wine than this."
I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name.
"So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers."
I'm terrible?
I've heard stories.
Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?
To see if you were the right kind of terrible.
Which kind is that?
The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.
I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.
"Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed."
Perhaps it won't come to that.
It's not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.
Varys? King Robert's spy master?
Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.
Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.
He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn't have to do. I suspect he's the main reason you weren't slaughtered in your crib.
But you trust him?
"Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother."
The brother who killed my father.
That's the one.
Perhaps I will have you killed after all.
"Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting."
I'm not going to kill you.
No? Banish me?
No.
"So if I'm not going to be murdered, and I'm not going to be banished..."
You're going to advise me. While you can still speak in complete sentences.
Advise you on what?
How to get what I want.
The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.
If I want jokes I'll get myself a proper fool.
I'm not entirely joking. There's more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.
I fought so that no child born into Slaver's Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.
"And when you get back to your home, who supports you?"
The common people.
"Let's be generous and assume that's going to happen. Here in Slaver's Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won't back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won't back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough."
"Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They're all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground."
It's a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You're not the first person to have dreamt it.
I'm not going to stop the wheel. I'm going to break the wheel.
You said whoever wins would fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen. I won.
I've been flogged if it makes you happy. I'm the best you've got. If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for?
Let me fight for her and I belong to you.
"I'll get out of here, you realize. Before long."
I can make you a wealthy woman. A lady of the court.
"I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die."
No.
How are you?
You know what I mean.
Are you scared?
Me too.
Who's there?
Come in.
Not to worry. Men brawl from time to time. It's only natural.
You're a good lad.
Now then. How can I help?
Yes?
We've been fighting them for years.
"Wildlings are people, just like us. There are good ones and bad ones."
Olly...
"I've seen the army of the dead. I've seen the white walkers, and they're coming for us, for all the living. And when it's time we'll need every last man we can find."
"Jon's taking a risk, but he has to. We don't stand a chance otherwise. Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run."
With all my heart.
Try not to worry Olly. I've been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back.
Does that make me a fool?
He's not my prisoner.
We're allies.
We're not here to fight. We're here to talk.
My name's Jon Snow. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. We're not friends. We've never been friends. We won't become friends today. This isn't about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what's out there.
In normal times we wouldn't. But these aren't normal times. The white walkers don't care if a man's Free Folk or Crow. We're all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.
It's not a trick. It's a gift for those who join us.
Dragonglass. A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.
No. But I trust the man.
Come with me and I'll share these weapons.
There are good lands south of the wall. The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.
"I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We're prepared to give you that new life."
If you swear you join us when the real war begins.
He died.
I put an arrow through his heart.
"I'm not asking you to forget your dead. I'll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I'm asking you to think about your children now. They'll never have children of their own if we don't band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can't stop them. The Night's Watch can't stop them. And all the southern kings can't stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we'll give the fuckers a fight."
How many are with us? 5000?
We're leaving too many behind.
And he knew them better than I ever will.
Get in line! Get in line!
Hold the line! Hold the line!
Get them to the ship and come back for me!
Now!
You should be on one of those boats.
You have my word. I've given orders.
Night's Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!
The Dragonglass!
Go! Go! Go!
Let's go now! Now!
You're good at that. Where did you learn?
And good at putting holes in them.
What happened to the actress? The one who wanted you dead.
Mmm.
I can't.
I don't think I could remember all of the lines.
You wouldn't be safe. Not while she's looking for me.
She doesn't have a name.
Essos is east and Westeros is west. But what's west of Westeros?
Nobody does. That's where all the maps stop.
I'd like to see that.
What's that?
I don't want any.
I'd call that a successful gambit.
Would you?
Look around. The city has come back to life.
You made a pact with fanatics.
I did and it worked.
"If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you'd say the razor worked. That doesn't mean it won't cut your throat."
Spoken like a man who has never had to shave.
I'm going to miss you.
I know.
I hope you're right about this expedition of yours.
"If I don't return, you'll know I was wrong."
We need friends in Westeros. And we need ships.
"Most of all, we need our queen."
She'll come back. She has to. My heart's been broken too many times already.
I'll walk the rest of the way myself. I can't go off on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city.
Varys.
The most famous dwarf in the world.
Have been permitted? That's rather a tortured way of putting it.
Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?
The king is aware of their presence?
His Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.
"It is a request, Cousin Lancel. You are asking me for something, I'm refusing."
He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial.
Get out.
I choose violence.
Please tell His High Holiness he's always welcome to visit.
"You have a keen military mind, Pod."
My name is Brienne of Tarth. Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister I've come to speak with him. Tell him I have his sword.
"Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren't we?"
Podrick fucking Payne. I thought you'd be dead by now.
Are they in there?
You think they're fucking?
"Why not? I'd fuck her. You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?"
"Oh. Well, he'd fuck her, that's for sure. And she's fuck him, don't you think? The way she looks at him. The way all women look at him is frankly irritating. I preferred working with the little brother on that account. Come on, you're the one with the magic cock."
You must have shown it to her by now.
Is she? Oh.
Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?
"Now, that's the truth, isn't it? You want to learn that sort of fighting?"
"All right, let's start with your footwork."
Show me your stance.
"Now, listen to me, Pod. See how your feet are about a yard apart?"
"Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you. ‘Cause they do, Pod. Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire. Do it again. Come on, don't sulk."
I never thought you'd find her. I just assumed Sansa was dead.
Why would you assume that?
"In my experience, girls like her don't live very long."
I don't think you know many girls like her.
"Well, I'm proud of you. I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds."
"Of course my sister wants Sansa dead. The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey's murder, so there is that complication. What the hell are you doing here?"
I've come for the Blackfish.
You're welcome to have him.
Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.
With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?
The Tully army.
"They're a bit occupied at the moment. I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels, so you can see the conundrum."
The Tullys are rebels because they're fighting for their home?
Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.
As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.
Exactly.
We shouldn't argue about politics.
"You're a knight, Ser Jaime. I know there is honor in you. I've seen it myself."
I'm a Lannister. Don't ask me to betray my own house.
I do no such thing. Take Riverrun without bloodshed. Ride south with your mission complete and your army intact.
What do you propose?
Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce. Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.
Why would he abandon his ancestral home?
Because you'll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.
Have you ever met the Blackfish?
No.
He's even more stubborn than you are.
"All right. Try to talk some sense into the old goat. He won't listen, but his men might. Not everybody wants to die for someone else's home."
"I need your word. If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you'll grant us safe passage north."
You have my word. You have until nightfall.
You gave it to me for a purpose. I've achieved that purpose.
It's yours. It will always be yours.
"one last thing, Ser Jaime."
"Yes, Lady Brienne?"
"Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender, and if you attack the castle, honor compels me to fight for Sansa's kin."
Of course it does.
To fight you.
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.
"As I have said, my name is- -"
He always spoke highly of you.
Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.
He's not my friend.
"Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark. He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted. He gave me this sword to protect her. That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die."
You have more than she does.
Find the maester. We need to get a raven north to Sansa.
Tell her I failed.
There's to be a royal announcement?
Why wasn't I informed?
To stand by my son.
And? Was it just a rumor or something more?
"I am happy. You should both be as well. Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself."
Now it's like a man reborn.
Why don't you drink? Why don't either of you ever drink?
Why not?
And who made these rules? Your former masters?
Those miserable old shits didn't want you to be human. Have a drink with me.
And you? What's your excuse?
That's how you know it's working.
Here's to our queen. Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.
"To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, long may she reign."
Do you like it?
"Yes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...I'd like to have my own vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp's Delight. Only my close friends could drink it."
"Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath."
Grey worm?
"Right. Three lords walk into a tavern- - a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister. They order ale..."
"but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, “Spit it out, you see shit. Spit it out.”"
It's funnier in Westeros.
Yes.
"A story that's supposed to make you laugh, ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps."
"Missandei, do you like the wine?"
Tell a joke.
Ah!
You lied to us.
I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. The madam says- -
Lord Edmure.
I apologize for the way the Freys treated you. A man of your birth deserved better. You have my word you'll be properly fed and clothes from now on.
"The Blackfish is an old man. A good death is all he can hope for. But you, you have a child now, I've heard. A son you sired on your wedding night. You're a potent man."
"You should be with them both. I can arrange that, you realize? Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock. A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride. And when he comes of age, he'll have a keep of his own."
"I'll remind you that our houses are at war. I'm sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you, but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences."
Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation? It's not.
I'll leave the judgments to the gods.
I was your sister's prisoner once. She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.
"Perhaps, but she didn't. Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me. But I didn't hate her. I admired her. Far more than her husband or her son."
"No, I don't, but I'm telling you anyway because you're my prisoner. You don't have a choice. The love she had for her children, I was a little awed by it. Reminded me of my sister."
I'm not here to trade insults. Your sister was a strong- -
I'll talk about whomever I want.
"She loved her children. I suppose all mothers do, but Catelyn and Cersei, there's a fierceness you don't often see."
They'd do anything to protect their babies.
Start a war. Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies. The things we do for love.
"That's exactly why I came here. I love Cersei. You can laugh at that if you want. You can sneer. It doesn't matter. She needs me. And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun. I'll send for your baby boy."
"And I'll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult. Because you don't matter to me, Lord Edmure. Your son doesn't matter to me. The people in the castle don't matter to me. Only Cersei. And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her, that's what I'll do."
Come with us.
Your family is in the North. Come with us. Don't die for pride when you can fight for your blood.
Good. Bring him to me.
I was wrong. I admit it.
The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead. If the slavers' forces- -
And I have acknowledged that. I'm trying- -
"All right, what should the army do?"
And then?
Lady Crane?
You told her to kill me.
A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell and I'm going home.
