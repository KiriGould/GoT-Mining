# GoT-Mining
some fun with Game of Thrones

I put up a web page to play around with some of the stuff:
https://game-of-thrones.eu-de.mybluemix.net

There is a character classification based on IBM Watson Natural Language Classifier and a fake text generator based on the model
called GPT-2 released by OpenAI last year and a wrapper Library for GPT-2 from Max Woolf.
Moreover, you'll find a chatbot to explore the GoT Script.

There is also some more explanation about the different notebooks.
