Episode,Name,Sentence
Episode 1,jon snow,Go on. Father's watching.
Episode 1,jon snow,And your mother.
Episode 1,sansa stark,Thank you.
Episode 1,jon snow,"Don't think too much, Bran."
Episode 1,robb stark,Relax your bow arm.
Episode 1,catelyn stark,Do you have to?
Episode 1,catelyn stark,Ned. Ten is too young to see such things.
Episode 1,robb stark,"Lad, go run back and get the rest."
Episode 1,jon snow,Don't look away.
Episode 1,jon snow,Father will know if you do.
Episode 1,jon snow,You did well.
Episode 1,jon snow,What is it?
Episode 1,theon greyjoy,Mountain lion?
Episode 1,theon greyjoy,It's a freak.
Episode 1,robb stark,There are no direwolves south of the Wall.
Episode 1,jon snow,Now there are five.
Episode 1,jon snow,You want to hold it?
Episode 1,theon greyjoy,Right. Give it here.
Episode 1,robb stark,Put away your blade.
Episode 1,theon greyjoy,"I take orders from your father, not you."
Episode 1,jon snow,Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.
Episode 1,jon snow,I'm not a Stark. Get on.
Episode 1,robb stark,What is it?
Episode 1,theon greyjoy,"The runt of the litter. That one's yours, Snow."
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"As your brother, I feel it's my duty to warn you"
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"And you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock. One hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid."
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. [In a whisper, mimicking] We're Lannisters. Lannisters don't act like fools."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,What if Jon Arryn told someone?
Episode 1,jaime lannister,But who would he tell?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,My husband.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he's off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,You should be the Hand of the king.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"That's an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short."
Episode 1,catelyn stark,All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.
Episode 1,catelyn stark,I wonder if the old gods agree.
Episode 1,catelyn stark,"I am so sorry, my love."
Episode 1,catelyn stark,There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.
Episode 1,catelyn stark,They both have their health. Gods be good. [pause] The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.
Episode 1,catelyn stark,"You can always say no, Ned."
Episode 1,catelyn stark,We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber. I'm told he reads all night.
Episode 1,catelyn stark,How much could he possibly drink? A man of his … stature.
Episode 1,catelyn stark,"In any case, candles."
Episode 1,jon snow,Why's your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?
Episode 1,theon greyjoy,"It's for the queen, I bet. I hear she's [sleek as a mink?]"
Episode 1,robb stark,I hear the prince is a right royal prick.
Episode 1,theon greyjoy,Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.
Episode 1,robb stark,"Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair."
Episode 1,catelyn stark,"Gods, but they grow fast. [Seeing BRAN on the wall] Brandon!"
Episode 1,catelyn stark,How many times have I told you
Episode 1,catelyn stark,I want you to promise me
Episode 1,catelyn stark,D'you know what?
Episode 1,catelyn stark,You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.
Episode 1,catelyn stark,"Where's Arya? Sansa, where's your sister?"
Episode 1,arya stark,Move!
Episode 1,catelyn stark,Your Grace.
Episode 1,arya stark,Where's the Imp?
Episode 1,sansa stark,Will you shut up?
Episode 1,arya stark,Arya.
Episode 1,arya stark,That's Jaime Lannister. The queen's twin brother.
Episode 1,sansa stark,Would you please shut up.
Episode 1,catelyn stark,My queen.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"We've been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,I did hear something about that.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,And the other brother?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,There's the pretty one. And there's the clever one.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,I hear he hates that nickname.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Clever girl.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Have you?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,The gods gave me one blessing.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Don't get up.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?"
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"You've much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"She has odd cravings, our sister."
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don't leave me alone with these people."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses."
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"I thought you might say that. But since we're short on time, Come on, girls. See you at sundown."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Close the door!
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,We've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,No.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,I don't want to be his queen. I want to go home.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,I don't know.
Episode 1,sansa stark,Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I'm ugly?
Episode 1,catelyn stark,Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.
Episode 1,sansa stark,He's so handsome.
Episode 1,sansa stark,When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?
Episode 1,catelyn stark,Hush now. Your father hasn't even said yes.
Episode 1,sansa stark,Why would he say no? He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.
Episode 1,catelyn stark,He'd have to leave home. He'd have to leave me. And so would you.
Episode 1,sansa stark,You left your home to come here. And I'd be queen someday. Please make father say yes.
Episode 1,catelyn stark,Sansa…
Episode 1,sansa stark,"Please, please. It's the only thing I ever wanted."
Episode 1,jon snow,Uncle Benjen!
Episode 1,jon snow,Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.
Episode 1,jon snow,So take me with you when you go back.
Episode 1,jon snow,"Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will."
Episode 1,jon snow,I'm ready to swear your oath.
Episode 1,jon snow,I don't care about that.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.
Episode 1,jon snow,What're you doing back there?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Preparing for a night with your family. I've always wanted to see the Wall.
Episode 1,jon snow,You're Tyrion Lannister. The queen's brother?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"My greatest accomplishment. You – you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?"
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though."
Episode 1,jon snow,Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you."
Episode 1,jon snow,What the hell do you know about being a bastard?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,All dwarves are bastards in their fathers' eyes.
Episode 1,robb stark,Uncle Benjen.
Episode 1,robb stark,I'm good.
Episode 1,catelyn stark,"Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace?"
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Yes. Lovely country.
Episode 1,catelyn stark,"I'm sure it's very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?"
Episode 1,sansa stark,"Thirteen, Your Grace."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,You're tall. Still growing?
Episode 1,sansa stark,"I think so, Your Grace."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,And have you bled yet?
Episode 1,sansa stark,"No, Your Grace."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,And your dress. Did you make it?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Such talent. You must make something for me.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,I hear we might share a grandchild someday.
Episode 1,catelyn stark,I hear the same.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it's true.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale."
Episode 1,jaime lannister,No? Getting a little old for it?
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Well said.
Episode 1,sansa stark,Arya!
Episode 1,robb stark,Time for bed.
Episode 1,catelyn stark,I won't let him take you.
Episode 1,catelyn stark,"I'll say, ‘Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now.'"
Episode 1,catelyn stark,He only stops eating when it's time for a drink.
Episode 1,catelyn stark,This was sent from the Eyrie. What's she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn't been back there since her wedding.
Episode 1,catelyn stark,She's fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger.
Episode 1,catelyn stark,"Lysa's head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her son's life, if she wasn't certain her husband was murdered?"
Episode 1,catelyn stark,They murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.
Episode 1,catelyn stark,He spent half his life fighting Robert's wars. He owes him nothing. Your father and brother rode south once on a king's demand.
Episode 1,jorah mormont,A small gift for the new Khaleesi. Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you, ser. Are you from my country?"
Episode 1,jorah mormont,"Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. I served your father for many years. Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king."
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you, Magister."
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,"She's beautiful. … Ser Jorah, I don't know how to say ‘thank you' in Dothraki."
Episode 1,jorah mormont,There is no word for ‘thank you' in Dothraki.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Do you know the Common Tongue?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Is ‘no' the only word that you know?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other, it will be a miracle."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,The greatest in the land. My spear never misses.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Stop. STOP.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Are you completely mad?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,He saw us.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,It's all right. It's all right.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,He saw us!
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"I heard you the first time. Quite the little climber, aren't you? How old are you, boy?"
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Ten.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,The things I do for love.
Episode 2,jorah mormont,"You need to drink, child... And eat."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Isn't there anything else?
Episode 2,jorah mormont,The Dothraki have two things in abundance
Episode 2,jorah mormont,"We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace. Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality. You'd be more comfortable there."
Episode 2,jorah mormont,"As you wish, your Grace."
Episode 2,jorah mormont,Selling to one... Some poachers I caught on my land.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,One word and I'll hit you again.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?"
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Do you understand?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast..."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Little brother.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Beloved siblings.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Apparently not.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,What do you mean?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,The Maester says the boy may live.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,The children don't need to hear your filth. Come.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Please.
Episode 2,catelyn stark,"I would have dressed, your Grace."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now."
Episode 2,catelyn stark,I never knew.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you."
Episode 2,catelyn stark,I am grateful..
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Perhaps this time she'll listen.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,A sword for the wall?
Episode 2,jon snow,I already have one.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Good man. Have you swung it yet?
Episode 2,jon snow,Of course I have.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us."
Episode 2,jon snow,We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"Is it ""we"" already? Have you taken your vows then?"
Episode 2,jon snow,Soon enough.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"Give my regards to the Night's Watch. I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not, It's only for life."
Episode 2,arya stark,"Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. ""My things weren't properly folded"", she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway."
Episode 2,jon snow,It's good you've got help.
Episode 2,arya stark,"Watch. Nymeria, gloves."
Episode 2,jon snow,Impressive.
Episode 2,arya stark,"Shut up. Nymeria, gloves!"
Episode 2,jon snow,I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully.
Episode 2,arya stark,A present?
Episode 2,jon snow,Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.
Episode 2,arya stark,It's so skinny.
Episode 2,jon snow,"So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough."
Episode 2,arya stark,I can be quick.
Episode 2,jon snow,You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
Episode 2,arya stark,I think so.
Episode 2,jon snow,First lesson
Episode 2,arya stark,I know which end to use.
Episode 2,jon snow,"I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know."
Episode 2,arya stark,Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own.
Episode 2,jon snow,I came to say goodbye to Bran.
Episode 2,catelyn stark,You've said it.
Episode 2,jon snow,"I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid."
Episode 2,catelyn stark,I want you to leave.
Episode 2,catelyn stark,17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon. You came back a year later with another woman's son. And now you're leaving again.
Episode 2,catelyn stark,"That's what men always say when honor calls. That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. You do have a choice. And you've made it. I can't do it, Ned. I really can't."
Episode 2,robb stark,You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. I know it.
Episode 2,jon snow,You Starks are hard to kill.
Episode 2,robb stark,My mother?
Episode 2,jon snow,She was very kind.
Episode 2,robb stark,"Good. Next time I see you, you'll be all in black."
Episode 2,jon snow,It was always my color.
Episode 2,robb stark,"Farewell, Snow."
Episode 2,jon snow,"And you, Stark."
Episode 2,jon snow,"Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?"
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.
Episode 2,jon snow,Why do you read so much?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Look at me and tell me what you see.
Episode 2,jon snow,Is this a trick?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years."
Episode 2,jon snow,Until your brother killed that King.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?"
Episode 2,jon snow,"Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms."
Episode 2,jon snow,The Night's Watch protects the realm from...
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly."
Episode 2,catelyn stark,Talk to Poole about it.
Episode 2,catelyn stark,I don't care about appointments!
Episode 2,robb stark,I'll make the appointments. We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.
Episode 2,robb stark,When was the last time you left this room?
Episode 2,catelyn stark,I have to take care of him.
Episode 2,robb stark,"He's not going to die, mother. Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed."
Episode 2,catelyn stark,What if he's wrong? Bran needs me.
Episode 2,robb stark,"Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying..."
Episode 2,catelyn stark,Close the windows! I can't stand it! Please make them stop!
Episode 2,robb stark,Fire. You stay here. I'll come back.
Episode 2,catelyn stark,No!
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Have you ever seen a dragon?
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Everywhere? Even in the east?
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,The moon?
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,How old were you?
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Nine?!
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Will it take three years?
Episode 2,catelyn stark,What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.
Episode 2,catelyn stark,Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,"Saw what, my lady?"
Episode 2,catelyn stark,I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.
Episode 2,robb stark,They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,"If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you."
Episode 2,catelyn stark,I don't trust a raven to carry these words.
Episode 2,robb stark,I'll ride to King's Landing.
Episode 2,catelyn stark,No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.
Episode 2,robb stark,"Mother, you can't."
Episode 2,catelyn stark,I must.
Episode 2,catelyn stark,Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.
Episode 2,robb stark,What about Bran?
Episode 2,catelyn stark,I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Finish a man?
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.
Episode 2,sansa stark,"Pardon me, Ser."
Episode 2,sansa stark,"I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?"
Episode 2,sansa stark,"Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts."
Episode 2,sansa stark,Arya!
Episode 2,arya stark,What are you doing here? Go away.
Episode 2,sansa stark,He the butcher's boy.
Episode 2,arya stark,He's my friend.
Episode 2,arya stark,Stop it!
Episode 2,sansa stark,"Arya, stay out of this."
Episode 2,sansa stark,"No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!"
Episode 2,arya stark,Nymeria!
Episode 2,sansa stark,"Arya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help."
Episode 2,arya stark,You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go! Leave now!
Episode 2,arya stark,Go!
Episode 2,arya stark,I'm sorry.
Episode 2,arya stark,No.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,How dare you speak to your King in that manner?
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.
Episode 2,arya stark,That's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.
Episode 2,arya stark,That's not what happened!
Episode 2,arya stark,Liar!
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"She's not. Sansa, come here, darling."
Episode 2,sansa stark,I don't know. I don't remember. Everything happened so fast. I didn't see.
Episode 2,arya stark,Liar! Liar liar liar!
Episode 2,arya stark,Liar liar liar!
Episode 2,cersei lannister,She's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?
Episode 2,cersei lannister,We have another wolf.
Episode 2,sansa stark,"He doesn't mean Lady, does he? No no, not Lady! Lady didn't bite anyone! She's good!"
Episode 2,arya stark,Lady wasn't there! You leave her alone!
Episode 2,sansa stark,Stop them. Don't let them do it. Please! It wasn't Lady!
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Where is the beast?
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"Ser Ilyn, do me the honor."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Is this some trick?
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership."
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes."
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss."
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that."
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice."
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?"
Episode 3,varys,Lord Stark.
Episode 3,varys,I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me."
Episode 3,petyr baelish,All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree."
Episode 3,varys,His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,We are the lords of small matters here.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"Mmm, how much?"
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?"
Episode 3,petyr baelish,I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans."
Episode 3,varys,"You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"Please, it's nearly healed."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,How would you handle them?
Episode 3,cersei lannister,A royal army?
Episode 3,cersei lannister,And if the northerners rebel?
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?"
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.
Episode 3,arya stark,I'm practicing.
Episode 3,sansa stark,Practicing for what?
Episode 3,arya stark,The Prince.
Episode 3,arya stark,He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.
Episode 3,sansa stark,The Hound killed your friend.
Episode 3,arya stark,The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.
Episode 3,sansa stark,You're an idiot.
Episode 3,arya stark,"You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive."
Episode 3,sansa stark,I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?
Episode 3,arya stark,Go away!
Episode 3,arya stark,Mine.
Episode 3,arya stark,I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.
Episode 3,arya stark,It's called Needle.
Episode 3,arya stark,Stick 'em with the pointy end.
Episode 3,arya stark,I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.
Episode 3,arya stark,"I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa."
Episode 3,arya stark,So was I! He is a liar.
Episode 3,arya stark,But how you can let her marry someone like that?
Episode 3,arya stark,Winter is coming.
Episode 3,arya stark,I don't hate her. Not really.
Episode 3,arya stark,I can keep it?
Episode 3,robb stark,What are you telling him now?
Episode 3,robb stark,Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber.
Episode 3,robb stark,"How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall."
Episode 3,robb stark,Don't ever say that.
Episode 3,catelyn stark,It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.
Episode 3,catelyn stark,I would. We've done nothing wrong.
Episode 3,catelyn stark,"Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but..."
Episode 3,petyr baelish,Cat! Go on. Go upstairs.
Episode 3,catelyn stark,You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a…
Episode 3,petyr baelish,I meant no disrespect to you of all people.
Episode 3,catelyn stark,How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?
Episode 3,petyr baelish,No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.
Episode 3,catelyn stark,How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?
Episode 3,petyr baelish,A dear friend told me.
Episode 3,varys,Lady Stark.
Episode 3,catelyn stark,Lord Varys.
Episode 3,varys,To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.
Episode 3,catelyn stark,How did you know I was coming?
Episode 3,varys,"Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel."
Episode 3,catelyn stark,Do you know whose dagger this is?
Episode 3,varys,I must admit I do not.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine."
Episode 3,catelyn stark,Yours?
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger."
Episode 3,catelyn stark,To whom?
Episode 3,petyr baelish,Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,A charming man.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"And how's that going, Commander Mormont?"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Good news or bad?
Episode 3,petyr baelish,Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?
Episode 3,petyr baelish,Is she?
Episode 3,petyr baelish,I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.
Episode 3,catelyn stark,Ned! [poking her head out of a window]
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"The Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds."
Episode 3,jon snow,It's an improvement.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it."
Episode 3,jon snow,Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice
Episode 3,jon snow,They hate me because I'm better than they are.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.
Episode 3,catelyn stark,We have proof. We have the blade.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf."
Episode 3,catelyn stark,Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything."
Episode 3,catelyn stark,I won't forget this. You're a true friend.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,How could you be so stupid?
Episode 3,jaime lannister,Calm down.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?
Episode 3,jaime lannister,I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.
Episode 3,jaime lannister,Then what are you raving about?
Episode 3,cersei lannister,What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...
Episode 3,jaime lannister,We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,And my husband?
Episode 3,jaime lannister,I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Let me go.
Episode 3,jaime lannister,Never.
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world."
Episode 3,catelyn stark,I wish I could see the girls.
Episode 3,catelyn stark,Just for a moment.
Episode 3,catelyn stark,"I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,And if you find the proof?
Episode 3,catelyn stark,"My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday."
Episode 3,catelyn stark,Does he?
Episode 3,jaime lannister,One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.
Episode 3,jaime lannister,You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"I cut his head off, so no."
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... ""Burn them all."" If that's all, your Grace..."
Episode 3,jorah mormont,The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,From whom?
Episode 3,jorah mormont,"If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices"
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Tell them all to stop.
Episode 3,jorah mormont,You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Until I command them otherwise.
Episode 3,jorah mormont,You're learning to talk like a Queen.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,No!
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed."
Episode 3,jorah mormont,"Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?"
Episode 3,jon snow,You're leaving?
Episode 3,jon snow,What kind of reports?
Episode 3,jon snow,m ready. I won't let you down.
Episode 3,jon snow,But I'm better than every...
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,You're joking?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,And how do a bear's balls taste?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,They have a better chance finding feed than glory.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"I think he's starting to like me. ""Going below""?"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,So you're heading down to King's Landing too.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,What are you doing?
Episode 3,jorah mormont,"For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate."
Episode 3,jorah mormont,Armor.
Episode 3,jorah mormont,Slow.
Episode 3,jorah mormont,"It's true, but it also keeps a man alive."
Episode 3,jorah mormont,I've heard that your father was a famous warrior.
Episode 3,jorah mormont,He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.
Episode 3,jorah mormont,I don't think she wants to eat dog.
Episode 3,jorah mormont,I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.
Episode 3,jorah mormont,Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.
Episode 3,jon snow,Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Eight... no, nine."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids."
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,It's a boy.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,I know.
Episode 3,jon snow,"I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
Episode 3,jon snow,Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.
Episode 3,jon snow,"If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Of course.
Episode 3,jon snow,He'll never walk again.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow."
Episode 3,jon snow,"Farewell, My Lord."
Episode 3,arya stark,Who are you?
Episode 3,arya stark,It's too heavy.
Episode 3,arya stark,What if I drop it?
Episode 3,arya stark,I'm a girl.
Episode 3,arya stark,A needle.
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,We have visitors.
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,"Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting."
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,"Neither do I. But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say. Hodor! Help Bran down the hall."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.
Episode 4,robb stark,Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?"
Episode 4,robb stark,"I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,Then you might learn a lordo s courtesy.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,Curious.
Episode 4,robb stark,Why are you here?
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Do you like to ride, Bran?"
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
Episode 4,robb stark,Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things."
Episode 4,robb stark,You've done my brother a kindness. The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier."
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,"Couldn't resist some northern ass? If you like redheads, ask for Ros."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters."
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,He's not my master.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?"
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,She wasn't feeling well.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?"
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,My lady's whereabouts...
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?"
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,Must have been a pretty sight.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out."
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,We were outnumbered 10 to one.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire."
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,"Careful, Imp."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out."
Episode 4,jon snow,"Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it."
Episode 4,jon snow,Enough! He yielded.
Episode 4,jon snow,Are you sure you want to do this?
Episode 4,jon snow,I've had worse.
Episode 4,jon snow,"It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself."
Episode 4,jon snow,The Wall's no place for cowards.
Episode 4,jorah mormont,Vaes Dothrak. The city of the horselords.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,These are my people now. You shouldn't call them savages.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?"
Episode 4,jorah mormont,The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea. They fear any water their horses can't drink.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,But if they did?
Episode 4,jorah mormont,"King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different."
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,And you know these men?
Episode 4,jorah mormont,"I fought beside them once, long ago. Now Ned Stark wants my head. He drove me from my land."
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,You sold slaves.
Episode 4,jorah mormont,Aye.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Why?
Episode 4,jorah mormont,I had no money and an expensive wife.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,And where is she now?
Episode 4,jorah mormont,"In another place, with another man."
Episode 4,sansa stark,What if I have a girl?
Episode 4,sansa stark,What if I only have girls?
Episode 4,sansa stark,"Jeyne Poole's mother had five children, all of them girls."
Episode 4,sansa stark,But what if?
Episode 4,sansa stark,And everyone would hate me.
Episode 4,sansa stark,Joffrey does.
Episode 4,sansa stark,Please shut up about it.
Episode 4,sansa stark,Aegon the Conqueror.
Episode 4,sansa stark,Maegor the Cruel.
Episode 4,sansa stark,"My grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren't they?"
Episode 4,sansa stark,The Mad King.
Episode 4,sansa stark,Why were they killed?
Episode 4,sansa stark,"I don't want to speak to my father, ever."
Episode 4,sansa stark,"No, I won't."
Episode 4,varys,Dreadful.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,I will?
Episode 4,varys,"The realm prospers from such events, my Lord. They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes."
Episode 4,petyr baelish,And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged.
Episode 4,arya stark,Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.
Episode 4,arya stark,Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
Episode 4,arya stark,He says every swordsman should study cats. They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. You have to be quick to catch them.
Episode 4,arya stark,Now that Bran's awake will he come live with us?
Episode 4,arya stark,"He wants to be a knight of the King's Guard. He can't be one now, can he?"
Episode 4,arya stark,Can I be Lord of a holdfast?
Episode 4,arya stark,No. That's not me.
Episode 4,jon snow,Come stand by the fire. It's warmer.
Episode 4,jon snow,You're not. You're freezing.
Episode 4,jon snow,"You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam?"
Episode 4,jon snow,"Yes, he is."
Episode 4,jon snow,Well… You can't get any worse.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,I hear you're reading a boring book.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"He never stops. Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squire... Jon Arryn's squire. He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death."
Episode 4,petyr baelish,I promised Cat that I'd help you.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,A singularly bad idea. Do you see that boy there? One of Varys's little birds. The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there. That one belongs to the Queen. And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?
Episode 4,petyr baelish,No. She's one of mine. Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"The wiser answer was no, my Lord. Get a message to this paragon of yours... Discreetly. Send him to question Ser Hugh. After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city. He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel."
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death."
Episode 4,petyr baelish,Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Listen. Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Guess.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,He likes to do this when I'm on duty... He makes me listen as he insults my sister.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"Have we? Strange, I've forgotten."
Episode 4,jaime lannister,That's where you got your scar?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Vicious sons of whores.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. D'you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,I doubt it.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,I don't serve Lord Stark.
Episode 4,jon snow,Watch duty. With Sam.
Episode 4,jon snow,He wasn't hungry.
Episode 4,jon snow,"That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him."
Episode 4,jon snow,No one touches Sam.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"Hush now. It's all right. Irri, take her and leave us."
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Why did you hit her?!
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,I wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,It's a gift. I had it made for you.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Please.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Stop - stop it.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,You've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.
Episode 4,jon snow,I wouldn't doubt it.
Episode 4,jon snow,Sally on the side?
Episode 4,jon snow,I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.
Episode 4,jon snow,"As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you."
Episode 4,jon snow,"I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but..."
Episode 4,jon snow,I know where to put it.
Episode 4,jon snow,Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.
Episode 4,jon snow,Red.
Episode 4,jon snow,You don't want to know.
Episode 4,jon snow,Better.
Episode 4,jon snow,What's my name?
Episode 4,jon snow,And why is my surname Snow?
Episode 4,jon snow,"I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child."
Episode 4,jon snow,I build my own fires.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,I hit him. I hit the dragon.
Episode 4,jorah mormont,Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,He is still the true King.
Episode 4,jorah mormont,The truth now
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.
Episode 4,jorah mormont,"The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They don't care what games the high Lords play."
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?"
Episode 4,jorah mormont,Home.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,Lover's quarrel?
Episode 4,sansa stark,I'm sorry. Do I...?
Episode 4,petyr baelish,An old friend of the family. I've known your mother a long long time.
Episode 4,arya stark,Why do they call you Littlefinger?
Episode 4,sansa stark,Arya!
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"No, it's quite all right. When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname."
Episode 4,sansa stark,"Gods, who is that?"
Episode 4,petyr baelish,Ser Gregor Clegane. They call him the Mountain. The Houndo s older brother.
Episode 4,sansa stark,And his opponent?
Episode 4,petyr baelish,Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story."
Episode 4,sansa stark,I won't tell anyone. I promise.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"No, please don't. If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you."
Episode 4,cersei lannister,You're missing your tournament.
Episode 4,cersei lannister,I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us – the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?
Episode 4,cersei lannister,"The only Stark who does. Favors her mother, not much of the north in her."
Episode 4,cersei lannister,I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?
Episode 4,cersei lannister,"You can't change him. You can't help him. He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done. You'll try your best to pick up the pieces."
Episode 4,cersei lannister,"You're just a soldier, aren't you? You take your orders and you carry on. I suppose it makes sense. Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow."
Episode 4,cersei lannister,As was I.
Episode 4,catelyn stark,And to you.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"My men can sleep in the stable. As for myself, I don't require a large room."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this?
Episode 4,bronn,You can have my room.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"There's a clever man. You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,Nothing would more likely ruin my supper. Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure. I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.
Episode 4,catelyn stark,"I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here. You, Ser... Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?"
Episode 4,catelyn stark,And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father... Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?
Episode 4,catelyn stark,The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun. My father counts Jonas Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"I envy your father all his fine friends, but I don't quite see the purpose of this."
Episode 4,catelyn stark,Knight of House Frey
Episode 4,catelyn stark,"This man... Came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of 10. In the name of King Robert and the good Lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king's justice."
Episode 5,sansa stark,At her dancing lessons. The Knight of the Flowers.
Episode 5,sansa stark,"Thank you, Ser Loras."
Episode 5,sansa stark,Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.
Episode 5,sansa stark,I can't watch.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,100 gold dragons on the Mountain.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?
Episode 5,sansa stark,He's going to die.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?"
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"Loras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really."
Episode 5,sansa stark,Ser Loras would never do that! There's no honor in tricks.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,No honor but quite a bit of gold.
Episode 5,catelyn stark,Remove his hood.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,This isn't the Kingsroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell.
Episode 5,catelyn stark,I did... often and loudly.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Wordo s probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?"
Episode 5,catelyn stark,And why would I do that?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.
Episode 5,catelyn stark,Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?"
Episode 5,catelyn stark,Five years ago.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here."
Episode 5,catelyn stark,"I am not a murderer, Lannister."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!
Episode 5,catelyn stark,The dagger found
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Why? Am I starting to make sense?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"Untie me. If I die, what's the point?"
Episode 5,catelyn stark,Rodrik?
Episode 5,bronn,Your first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"Well, I'm willing if she is."
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,"Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking."
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,Shh... Keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,Important enough for the likes of you.
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,Who? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman.
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,Why should I be jealous?
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,Hmm?
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,"I'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters."
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,I've been Lord Stark's ward since I was eight years old.
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,I'm not a boy.
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,I don't want to pay for it.
Episode 5,arya stark,Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.
Episode 5,varys,"How is your son, my Lord?"
Episode 5,varys,But his mind is sound?
Episode 5,varys,A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?
Episode 5,varys,"If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him."
Episode 5,varys,I didn't trust you.
Episode 5,varys,"The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem."
Episode 5,varys,"The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace."
Episode 5,varys,"Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn."
Episode 5,varys,"Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely."
Episode 5,varys,Someone who could afford it.
Episode 5,varys,He started asking questions.
Episode 5,varys,He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.
Episode 5,varys,"The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend."
Episode 5,varys,This Hand is not the other.
Episode 5,varys,"Delay,"" you say. ""Move fast, "" I reply. This is no longer a game for two players."
Episode 5,varys,The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,You do move quietly.
Episode 5,varys,We all have our qualities.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.
Episode 5,varys,I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations."
Episode 5,varys,"Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important."
Episode 5,varys,"Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?"
Episode 5,petyr baelish,All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.
Episode 5,varys,And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws."
Episode 5,varys,Strictly speaking.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered."
Episode 5,varys,"Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?"
Episode 5,petyr baelish,Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
Episode 5,varys,"Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,Saw me with your own eyes?
Episode 5,varys,Eyes I own.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.
Episode 5,varys,Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen...
Episode 5,petyr baelish,One shudders at the thought.
Episode 5,varys,Oh.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.
Episode 5,varys,Have you?
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers."
Episode 5,varys,Was that you under the bed?
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friendo s sympathies… To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm."
Episode 5,varys,"Oh, please."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King --
Episode 5,petyr baelish,To a small council meeting?
Episode 5,varys,Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?
Episode 5,arya stark,I'm not a beggar. I live here.
Episode 5,arya stark,I want to see my father.
Episode 5,arya stark,"My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?"
Episode 5,arya stark,They said they were going to kill you.
Episode 5,arya stark,"I didn't see them, but I think one was fat."
Episode 5,arya stark,I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage.
Episode 5,arya stark,"In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls."
Episode 5,arya stark,Chasing a cat.
Episode 5,arya stark,I'm a girl!
Episode 5,arya stark,How many guards does my father have?
Episode 5,arya stark,"You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?"
Episode 5,catelyn stark,To whom do I speak?
Episode 5,catelyn stark,There was no time to send word.
Episode 5,catelyn stark,That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.
Episode 5,catelyn stark,My sister will decide what he looks like.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.
Episode 5,bronn,Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,I like you.
Episode 5,varys,"No rumor, my Lord. The princess is with child."
Episode 5,varys,Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man."
Episode 5,varys,"I understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word ""treason"" was mentioned."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,When do you return to Winterfell?
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.
Episode 5,catelyn stark,"Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t-"
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do."
Episode 5,catelyn stark,This man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces."
Episode 5,cersei lannister,No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?
Episode 5,cersei lannister,The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Is my father wrong?
Episode 5,cersei lannister,We still outnumber them.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Five.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,What do you want?
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Our marriage.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Every day.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"Well, seventeen years is quite a long time."
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"Yes, it tis. What was she like?"
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it."
Episode 5,cersei lannister,What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"I felt something for you once, you know?"
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a... moment?"
Episode 5,cersei lannister,It doesn't make me feel anything.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"Brothels make a much better investment than ship, I've found. Whores rarely sink."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"Well, he has more than you, for a start."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Such a small pack of wolves.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Was!... the Hand of the King. Now I'm not sure what he is... Lord of somewhere very far away.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"What's the meaning of this, Lannister?"
Episode 5,jaime lannister,"Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man."
Episode 5,jaime lannister,"It seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?"
Episode 5,petyr baelish,My Lords! I'll bring the City Watch!
Episode 5,jaime lannister,"Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand."
Episode 5,jaime lannister,"Threaten? As in, ""I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of”?"
Episode 5,jaime lannister,You're right. Take him alive! Kill his men!
Episode 5,jaime lannister,"My brother, Lord Stark... We want him back."
Episode 6,cersei lannister,Do you know what your wife has done?
Episode 6,cersei lannister,By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?
Episode 6,cersei lannister,You were the King's Hand!
Episode 6,cersei lannister,You shall now be held accountable.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,I took you for a king.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,He's attacked my brother and abducted the other. I should wear the armor and you the gown.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,I shall wear this like a badge of honor.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,You're hurt.
Episode 6,robb stark,Not too fast.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,When are you gonna tell him?
Episode 6,robb stark,Not now.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,Blood for blood. You need to make the Lannisters to pay for Jory and the others.
Episode 6,robb stark,You're talking about war.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,I'm talking about justice.
Episode 6,robb stark,Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,A Lannister put his spear through your father's leg. The Kingslayer rides to Casterly Rock where no one can touch -
Episode 6,robb stark,You want me to march on Casterly Rock?!
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,You're not a boy anymore. They attacked your father. They've already started the war. It's your duty to represent your House when your father can't.
Episode 6,robb stark,"And it's not your duty, because it's not your House."
Episode 6,robb stark,Where's Bran?
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,I don't know. It's not my House.
Episode 6,robb stark,Drop the knife. Let him go and I'll let you live.
Episode 6,robb stark,Are you all right?
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"Tough little lad. In the Iron Islands, you're not a man until you've killed your first enemy. Well done."
Episode 6,robb stark,Have you lost your mind? What if you'd missed?
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,He would have killed you and cut Bran's throat.
Episode 6,robb stark,You don't have the right -
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"To what, to save your brother's life? It was the only thing to do, so I did it."
Episode 6,robb stark,What about her?
Episode 6,robb stark,We'll keep her alive.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Mord! Turnkey! Mord! Mord!
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,How would you like to be rich?
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"My family is rich. We have gold, lots of gold. I'm prepared to give you lots of gold."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Well, I don't have it here."
Episode 6,arya stark,I don't want to practice today.
Episode 6,arya stark,They killed Jory. My father is hurt. I don't care about stupid wooden swords.
Episode 6,arya stark,Yes -
Episode 6,arya stark,I don't like dolls and k -
Episode 6,jorah mormont,She's doing well.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,The prince is riding. I have heard the thunder of the hooves. Swift as the wind he rides. His enemies will cower before him… and their wives will weep tears of blood.”
Episode 6,jorah mormont,She's going to have a boy.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,"The stallion who mounts the world.” The stallion, is the khal of khals. He shall unite the people into a single khalasar. All the people of the world will be his herd."
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,A prince rides inside me! And he shall be called Rhaego!
Episode 6,jorah mormont,She truly is a queen today.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,Don't let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak. You know the law.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,They don't belong to you.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,"Once, perhaps."
Episode 6,jorah mormont,And you have all three.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,"You can go, but you can't have the eggs."
Episode 6,jorah mormont,It means everything to me.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,And here I stand.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord!
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,About the gold -
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Listen to me! Listen to me! Sometimes possession… is an abstract concept. When they captured me they took my purse, but the gold is still mine."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Where? I don't know where, but when they free me -"
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Have you ever heard the phrase “Rich as a Lannister”? Of course you have. You're a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, “a Lannister always pays his debts.” If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Yes, my lady. I do, my lady."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I'm a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I'm not particularly good at violence, but I'm good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle's boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and… I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -"
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Confessing my crimes.
Episode 6,catelyn stark,"Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister's husband; Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I'm very sorry. I don't know anything about all that."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King's Justice? I'm accused and demand a trial."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,I understand the law.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Agreed.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"I wouldn't be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Send a raven for him, I'm happy to wait."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Do I have a volunteer?
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Anyone?... Anyone?
Episode 6,bronn,I'll stand for the dwarf.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,Fish. The sigil of House Tully. Isn't that your wife's House - Tully - my Lord Hand?
Episode 6,petyr baelish,That sounds like someone we know. The Mountain.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,I've heard him called “Tywin Lannister's mad dog.” I'm sure you have as well. Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?
Episode 6,petyr baelish,It would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,"A bold move, my Lord, and admirable. But is it wise to yank the lion's tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. Gold wins wars, not soldiers."
Episode 6,bronn,No. He did.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Not this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,A Lannister always pays his debts.
Episode 6,sansa stark,"Well, why shouldn't I? We're in the south."
Episode 6,sansa stark,My mother isn't from the North.
Episode 6,sansa stark,Why do you care? Do you even have hair under there?
Episode 6,sansa stark,I've never seen it.
Episode 6,sansa stark,"No. Where are you from anyway, the north or the south?"
Episode 6,sansa stark,"Oh, wait. I just realized… I don't care."
Episode 6,sansa stark,Septa.
Episode 6,sansa stark,My prince.
Episode 6,sansa stark,It's beautiful. Like the one your mother wears.
Episode 6,sansa stark,There's nothing to forgive.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,Stop! Stop! What are you doing?!
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,In a turnip cart?
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,And you can afford that?
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,There's a thousand girls like you in King's Landing.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"Yes, you'll be very popular until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and he can't get it up so he knocks all your teeth out."
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,Don't be a fool.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,Let me see it one more time?
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,I'm going to miss you!
Episode 6,sansa stark,What?!
Episode 6,sansa stark,What about Joffrey?
Episode 6,arya stark,Are you dying because of your leg? Is that why you're sending us home?
Episode 6,sansa stark,"Please, Father. Please don't."
Episode 6,arya stark,You can't. I've got my lessons with Syrio. I'm finally getting good.
Episode 6,arya stark,Can't we take Syrio back with us?
Episode 6,sansa stark,Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher? I can't go. I'm supposed to marry Prince Joffrey. I love him and I'm meant to be his queen and have his babies.
Episode 6,arya stark,Seven hells.
Episode 6,sansa stark,"I don't want someone brave and gentle and strong. I want him! He'll be the greatest king that ever was, a golden lion, and I'll give him sons with beautiful blond hair."
Episode 6,arya stark,"The lion's not his sigil, idiot. He's a stag, like his father."
Episode 6,sansa stark,He is not. He's nothing like that old drunk king.
Episode 6,sansa stark,Wait!
Episode 6,arya stark,Come on!
Episode 6,sansa stark,It's not fair!
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,Stop him.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,Come.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,Khal Drogo says there is a place for you. Back there.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,"Viserys, please."
Episode 6,jorah mormont,Put the sword down. They'll kill us all.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,"He says yes. You shall have a golden crown, that men shall tremble to behold."
Episode 6,jorah mormont,Look away Khaleesi.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,No.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,Khaleesi…
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,He was no dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"Summoned to court to answer for the crimes of your bannerman Gregor Clegane, the Mountain"
Episode 7,tywin lannister,Attacking him was stupid.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,Lannisters don't act like fools.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Catelyn Stark took my brother.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,Why is he still alive?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Tyrion?
Episode 7,tywin lannister,Ned Stark.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"One of our men interfered, speared him through the leg before I could finish him."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,It wouldn't have been clean.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,Clean...
Episode 7,tywin lannister,You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,I could care less what anyone thinks of me.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,Now that's what you want people to think of you.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,It's the truth.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,"When you hear them whispering ""Kingslayer"" behind your back, doesn't it bother you?"
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Of course it bothers me.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,I didn't realize you placed such a high value on my brother's life.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,"He's a Lannister. He might be the lowest of the Lannisters, but he's one of us."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of..
Episode 7,tywin lannister,"No, it's not an opinion, it's a fact!"
Episode 7,tywin lannister,Hmm.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,You're in pain.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Perhaps it's time to go home.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"Do you, Lord Stark? Is that why you called me here, to pose me riddles?"
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Jaime would have killed him.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Jaime and I are more than brother and sister. We shared a womb. We came into this world together. We belong together.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Do you love your children?
Episode 7,cersei lannister,No more than I love mine.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Thank the Gods.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Hated him? I worshiped him.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"And what of my wrath, Lord Stark? You should have taken the realm for yourself."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"Oh, but it was."
Episode 7,petyr baelish,"No no no no! Is that what they teach you up in the North? And you-- wherever you're from, do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? Either of you understand a thing that I'm saying?"
Episode 7,petyr baelish,"Let's start over, shall we? You be the man and you be the woman."
Episode 7,petyr baelish,I'm saving myself for another.
Episode 7,petyr baelish,A stupid saying.
Episode 7,petyr baelish,"No, not really. Impeccable bloodlines though."
Episode 7,petyr baelish,For many years. Most of my life really.
Episode 7,petyr baelish,Oh no. He got himself killed before the wedding.
Episode 7,petyr baelish,"Oh, everything, my dear. Everything there is."
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,You're a very lucky girl. Do you know that?
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,The Iron Islands.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,You've never heard of the Iron Islands?
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,"Trust me, My Lord. You're not living in the wilderness anymore."
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,Lord.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,"Why? What do you mean why? My father is Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands."
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,I will be lord after my father.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,"No, you...You having a go at me? Is that it?"
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,I'm not a Southerner.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,"You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?"
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,Impudent. It means rude. Disrespectful.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,I thought she was our prisoner.
Episode 7,jon snow,Why is he alone?
Episode 7,jon snow,There's no rider.
Episode 7,jon snow,That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"Robert, my sweet..."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"According to the prophecy, the stallions will ride to the ends of the world."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"The earth does not end at the sea, there are many dirts beyond the sea."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"Lands, yes..."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,It's not a chair. It's a...
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"A chair for a King to sit upon, or a Queen."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Can't you help me make him understand?
Episode 7,jorah mormont,"The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"My brother was a fool, I know, but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms."
Episode 7,jorah mormont,"Forgive me, Khaleesi, but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didn't seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,And because he had dragons.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,"Ah well, having a few dragons makes things easier."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,You don't believe it.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,"Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi? I believe what my eyes and ears report."
Episode 7,jorah mormont,"No no, don't trouble yourself. Enjoy the market. I'll rejoin you soon enough."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"My son already has his name, but I'll try your summerwine."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Rise. I'd still like to taste that wine.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"You honor me, Ser."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,I hope to repay your kindness someday.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,Rakharo.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Is something wrong?
Episode 7,jorah mormont,I have a thirst. Open it.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,Open it.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,Pour.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Do as he says.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,You first.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,You will drink.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,Come.
Episode 7,jon snow,"I do, my lord."
Episode 7,jon snow,"Yes, my lord."
Episode 7,jon snow,Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath.
Episode 7,jon snow,Do you take me for a servant?
Episode 7,jon snow,May I go?
Episode 7,jon snow,"I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all."
Episode 7,jon snow,"I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger."
Episode 7,petyr baelish,My Lord protector.
Episode 7,petyr baelish,So when the King dies...
Episode 7,petyr baelish,So it would seem. Unless...
Episode 7,petyr baelish,And he cannot take the throne without your help.
Episode 7,petyr baelish,You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm.
Episode 7,petyr baelish,"You'll need someone to share these burdens. I assure you, my price would be modest."
Episode 7,petyr baelish,Only if we lose.
Episode 7,petyr baelish,So it will be Stannis and war?
Episode 7,petyr baelish,"So why did you call me here? Not for my wisdom, clearly."
Episode 7,petyr baelish,Look at you. You know what you want me to do.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"I thought he'd leave me alone, now that my brother is gone."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,He will not have my son.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,You think he stands alone?
Episode 7,petyr baelish,Now!
Episode 7,petyr baelish,I did warn you not to trust me.
Episode 8,sansa stark,She didn't forget. She's with her dancing master.
Episode 8,sansa stark,What is it? What's happening?
Episode 8,arya stark,"You said right, but you went left."
Episode 8,arya stark,Only 'cause you lied.
Episode 8,arya stark,"I was so. I watched, but you..."
Episode 8,arya stark,My father wouldn't send you.
Episode 8,arya stark,And I don't have to go with you if I don't want.
Episode 8,arya stark,Come with me. Run.
Episode 8,arya stark,Not today.
Episode 8,arya stark,Not today. Not today.
Episode 8,sansa stark,Stay away from me.
Episode 8,arya stark,Needle.
Episode 8,arya stark,What do you want?
Episode 8,arya stark,Leave me be. My father's a lord. He'll reward you.
Episode 8,arya stark,Stay away!
Episode 8,jon snow,"Just these two, My Lord. Been dead awhile, I'd say."
Episode 8,jon snow,We should burn them.
Episode 8,jon snow,Is there any word of my father?
Episode 8,jon snow,My sisters were in King's Landing too.
Episode 8,sansa stark,He wouldn't do that. He knows how much I love Joffrey.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"Sansa sweetling, you are innocent of any wrong."
Episode 8,sansa stark,"No, I'm not."
Episode 8,petyr baelish,"The girl is innocent, Your Grace."
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"Little dove, you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother, the eldest."
Episode 8,sansa stark,Robb.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"Word of your father's arrest will reach him soon, no doubt."
Episode 8,sansa stark,"If...if I could see my father, talk to him about..."
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"You disappoint me, child."
Episode 8,sansa stark,I only meant that...what will happen to him?
Episode 8,cersei lannister,That depends.
Episode 8,sansa stark,On...on what?
Episode 8,cersei lannister,On your brother. And on you.
Episode 8,robb stark,Treason? Sansa wrote this?
Episode 8,robb stark,"Joffrey puts my father in chains, now he wants his ass kissed?"
Episode 8,robb stark,"I won't refuse. His Grace summons me to King's Landing, I'll go to King's Landing."
Episode 8,catelyn stark,You will not support us then? Do I understand you correctly?
Episode 8,catelyn stark,That is what I ask.
Episode 8,catelyn stark,If you fear for the safety of your son...
Episode 8,catelyn stark,And that is why we have to stop them.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"And feed it to the goats, yes."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Uncle. Father.
Episode 8,tywin lannister,The rumors of your demise were unfounded.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Sorry to disappoint you.
Episode 8,tywin lannister,And who are these Companions of yours?
Episode 8,tywin lannister,"This is Shagga Son of Dolf, Chieftain of the Stone Crows."
Episode 8,bronn,You wouldn't know him.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"May I present My Lord Father, Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister."
Episode 8,tywin lannister,You left us no choice. The honor of the House was at stake.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"We have our differences, Jaime and I."
Episode 8,jaime lannister,He's been covering himself in glory.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,And the Starks? Lord Eddard?
Episode 8,tywin lannister,Is our hostage.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned?
Episode 8,tywin lannister,Robert Baratheon is dead.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"My sister rules, you mean."
Episode 8,tywin lannister,A green boy.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Maybe. Though the boy does have a certain belligerence.
Episode 8,tywin lannister,The wolf rushes into the lion's jaws.
Episode 8,tywin lannister,It is said that the men of the Mountain clans are great warriors.
Episode 8,robb stark,To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at The Twins.
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,Lord Frey controls that bridge.
Episode 8,catelyn stark,"The late Lord Frey"" my father calls him."
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,Robb's right.
Episode 8,robb stark,Where did you find him?
Episode 8,robb stark,How high did you get?
Episode 8,robb stark,"My father understands mercy, when there is room for it."
Episode 8,catelyn stark,Robb.
Episode 8,robb stark,"Tell Lord Tywin, Winter is coming for him."
Episode 8,robb stark,You call me boy again.
Episode 8,robb stark,Go on.
Episode 8,sansa stark,Ser Aron.
Episode 8,sansa stark,Lord Gyles.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,Ser Barristan Selmy.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"Rise, Ser Barristan."
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"Whose death, Ser Barristan? Yours or your King's?"
Episode 8,cersei lannister,The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"Careful, Ser."
Episode 8,petyr baelish,"A naked Knight, apparently."
Episode 8,sansa stark,Your Grace.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"Do you have some business for the King and the Council, Sansa?"
Episode 8,sansa stark,I do.
Episode 8,sansa stark,"As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father, Lord Eddard Stark, who was Hand of the King."
Episode 8,sansa stark,"Thank you, Your Grace."
Episode 8,petyr baelish,Do you deny your father's crime?
Episode 8,sansa stark,"No, My Lords. I know he must be punished."
Episode 8,sansa stark,He was badly hurt.
Episode 8,sansa stark,"If you still have any affection in your heart for me, please do me this kindness, Your Grace."
Episode 8,sansa stark,He will.
Episode 9,varys,"You've seen better days, my lord."
Episode 9,varys,"No, no, many still love you. Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life."
Episode 9,varys,"You do me wrong, my lord. Your blood is the last thing l want."
Episode 9,varys,"When l was still a boy - before they cut my balls off with a hot knife - l traveled with a group of actors through the free cities. They taught me that each man has a role to play. The same is true at court. l am the master of whisperers. My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples. l'm a good actor, my lord."
Episode 9,varys,"l could. But will l? No. As l said, I'm no hero."
Episode 9,varys,Peace. Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad. Fighting for his father's freedom.
Episode 9,varys,Boys have been conquerors before. But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the king's the late king's brother. Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne. He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.
Episode 9,varys,Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life. lt would be a shame to throw it away. Cersei is no fool. She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.
Episode 9,varys,"l want you to serve the realm! Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Cersei knows you as a man of honor. lf you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son."
Episode 9,varys,"Pity. Such a pity. What of your daughter's life, my lord? ls that a precious thing to you?"
Episode 9,robb stark,lt's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda.
Episode 9,theon greyjoy,Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
Episode 9,catelyn stark,Keep shooting them down. We can't risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.
Episode 9,robb stark,He's Grandfather's bannerman. We can't expect his support?
Episode 9,robb stark,Father rots in a dungeon. How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.
Episode 9,theon greyjoy,Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing. We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.
Episode 9,catelyn stark,"The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll."
Episode 9,robb stark,Have my horse saddled and ready.
Episode 9,theon greyjoy,Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.
Episode 9,robb stark,"My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing. Whatever it took. lf l'm going to lead this army, l can't have other men doing my bargaining for me."
Episode 9,catelyn stark,l agree. l'll go.
Episode 9,catelyn stark,l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl. He would never harm me.
Episode 9,catelyn stark,"lt is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord."
Episode 9,catelyn stark,ls there somewhere we can talk?
Episode 9,catelyn stark,l'm sure she will give you many sons.
Episode 9,catelyn stark,"He is quite ill, my lord."
Episode 9,catelyn stark,"My lord, l –"
Episode 9,catelyn stark,l'm sure there were reasons –
Episode 9,catelyn stark,"To ask you to open your gates, my lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way."
Episode 9,catelyn stark,"lf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls."
Episode 9,catelyn stark,You swore an oath to my father.
Episode 9,catelyn stark,Why don't you?
Episode 9,jon snow,"Soon, he says."
Episode 9,jon snow,This is Valyrian steel.
Episode 9,jon snow,"My lord, you honor me, but l can't –"
Episode 9,jon snow,"Yes, my lord."
Episode 9,jon snow,l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.
Episode 9,jon snow,At what?
Episode 9,jon snow,What is it?
Episode 9,jon snow,You can't what?
Episode 9,jon snow,And yet you really want to say. You want to say that…
Episode 9,jon snow,What? What about him?
Episode 9,jon snow,l should be there. l should be with him.
Episode 9,robb stark,Well? What did he say?
Episode 9,catelyn stark,"Lord Walder has granted your crossing. His men are yours, as well."
Episode 9,robb stark,Huh.
Episode 9,catelyn stark,Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.
Episode 9,robb stark,What does he want in return?
Episode 9,catelyn stark,You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.
Episode 9,robb stark,"Fine, fine. And?"
Episode 9,catelyn stark,And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.
Episode 9,robb stark,She won't be happy about that. And?
Episode 9,catelyn stark,And when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters. Whichever you prefer. He has a number he thinks will be suitable.
Episode 9,robb stark,l see. Did you get a look at his daughters?
Episode 9,catelyn stark,l did.
Episode 9,robb stark,And?
Episode 9,catelyn stark,One was – Do you consent?
Episode 9,robb stark,Can l refuse?
Episode 9,catelyn stark,Not if you want to cross.
Episode 9,robb stark,Then l consent.
Episode 9,jon snow,Sam said you wanted to see me?
Episode 9,jon snow,No.
Episode 9,jon snow,"He would do whatever was right, no matter what."
Episode 9,jon snow,Sam told you.
Episode 9,jon snow,And this is my day? ls that what you're saying?
Episode 9,jon snow,"You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother."
Episode 9,jon snow,Who are you?
Episode 9,jon snow,You're Aemon Targaryen.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,My lord… My sun and stars… Drogo.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,"He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest. We've ridden far enough today. We'll camp here."
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.
Episode 9,tywin lannister,"The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt."
Episode 9,tywin lannister,"l do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Shagga likes axes.
Episode 9,tywin lannister,"When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay."
Episode 9,tywin lannister,"When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.
Episode 9,tywin lannister,There'll be no more discussion on the matter.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?
Episode 9,bronn,l took her.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Took her? From whom?
Episode 9,bronn,"From, uh, Ser What's-his-name? l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,And he didn't have anything to say about it?
Episode 9,bronn,He said something.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow."
Episode 9,bronn,"Oh, well. l, uh, think l'll go and find myself one."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Who are you?
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,What did your mother call you?
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,My mother died giving birth to me.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,What sort of accent is that?
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,For-
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent. l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"One - safety. No one will hurt you for as long as you're mine. Two - the pleasure of my company, which l have heard is spectacular."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,And three - more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years. Do you accept my proposal?
Episode 9,jorah mormont,Khaleesi.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,Come. He's very strong. No one understands how strong he is.
Episode 9,jorah mormont,"He will die tonight, Khaleesi."
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,He can't. He can't. l won't let him.
Episode 9,jorah mormont,Even a queen doesn't have that power. We must go quickly. l've heard there's a good port in Asshai.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,l won't leave him.
Episode 9,jorah mormont,"He's already gone, Khaleesi."
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,"Even if he dies, why would l run? l am khaleesi, and my my son will be khal after Drogo."
Episode 9,jorah mormont,"This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs."
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,Stop it! l don't want her hurt.
Episode 9,jorah mormont,Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,l have never been nothing. l am the blood of the dragon.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,"l think you should wear your armor tonight, ser."
Episode 9,jorah mormont,l think you're right.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,And now you must save him.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,Save him and l will free you. l swear it. You must know a way. Some – some magic.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,Do it. Save him.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,"You'll have gold, whatever you want."
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,My death?
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,Kill her and you kill your khal.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,l am your khaleesi. l tell you what is forbidden.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,Take her and leave. Take her!
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,No one will enter.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,Bring him back to me.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,l have to save him.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,This must be.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,"No, you can't."
Episode 9,jorah mormont,"No further, horselord."
Episode 9,jorah mormont,Are you hurt?
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,The baby –
Episode 9,jorah mormont,Hmm?
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,is coming.
Episode 9,jorah mormont,Fetch the midwives.
Episode 9,jorah mormont,They'll come or l'll have their heads.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,No.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?"
Episode 9,bronn,Drink.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Let's play a new game.
Episode 9,bronn,There's a Braavosi knife game l could teach you.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?
Episode 9,bronn,Not if you win.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,l happen to be a great judge of character.
Episode 9,bronn,This sounds like a boring game.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"lt's not. Here's how it works - l make a statement about your past. lf l'm right, you drink. lf l'm wrong, l drink. And no lying. l'll know if you're lying."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.
Episode 9,bronn,But my mother hit harder.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,You killed your first man before you were 12.
Episode 9,bronn,lt was a woman. She swung an axe at me.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,You've been north of the Wall.
Episode 9,bronn,Work.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,And we've established the rules about lying?
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.
Episode 9,bronn,The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"So, specifics… You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?"
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Are you sure –
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,That's not how the game works.
Episode 9,bronn,Our lord here used to be married.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,How did you hear that?
Episode 9,bronn,You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Another night, perhaps."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,lt's not a pleasant story.
Episode 9,bronn,l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed."
Episode 9,bronn,"For three chickens, l should hope so."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father."
Episode 9,bronn,"Well, l imagine that was the end of all that."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor."
Episode 9,bronn,l would have killed the man who did that to me.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Really? l was 16, drunk and in love."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"As l said, l was young and stupid."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,What is it? What do you want?
Episode 9,bronn,You're sleeping through the war.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,What?
Episode 9,bronn,They stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Get my squire!
Episode 9,bronn,You don't have a squire.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"lf l die, weep for me."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,l'll know.
Episode 9,bronn,Stay low.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Stay low?
Episode 9,bronn,"lf you're lucky, no one will notice you."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"l was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours!"
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,To battle!
Episode 9,bronn,You're a shit warrior.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,l'm alive?
Episode 9,bronn,You're alive.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Did we win?
Episode 9,bronn,We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,How did our tribesmen do?
Episode 9,bronn,"Yeah, good."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,lt's nice to see them getting along.
Episode 9,tywin lannister,You're wounded.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Good of you to notice. l hear we won.
Episode 9,tywin lannister,"Huh! The scouts were wrong. There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20 [thousand]."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Did we get the Stark boy, at least?"
Episode 9,tywin lannister,He wasn't here.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Where was he?
Episode 9,tywin lannister,"With his other 18,000 men."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,And where are they?
Episode 9,catelyn stark,No!
Episode 9,robb stark,"By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened."
Episode 9,jaime lannister,"Lady Stark. l'd offer you my sword, but l seem to have lost it."
Episode 9,catelyn stark,lt is not your sword l want. Give me my daughters back. Give me my husband.
Episode 9,jaime lannister,"l've lost them too, l'm afraid."
Episode 9,theon greyjoy,"Kill him, Robb. Send his head to his father. He cut down ten of our men. You saw him."
Episode 9,robb stark,He's more use to us alive than dead.
Episode 9,catelyn stark,Take him away and put him in irons.
Episode 9,jaime lannister,"We could end this war right now, boy, save thousands of lives. You fight for the Starks, l fight for the Lannisters. Swords or lances, teeth, nails - choose your weapons and let's end this here and now."
Episode 9,robb stark,"lf we do it your way, Kingslayer, you'd win. We're not doing it your way."
Episode 9,robb stark,"l sent 2,000 men to their graves today."
Episode 9,theon greyjoy,The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.
Episode 9,robb stark,Aye. But the dead won't hear them. One victory does not make us conquerors. Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over.
Episode 9,arya stark,Could l have one? A lemon one or any of them.
Episode 9,arya stark,How about a nice fat pigeon?
Episode 9,arya stark,Do you have any stale ones from yesterday? Or any burnt ones?
Episode 9,arya stark,"Hey, where's everyone going? What's happening?"
Episode 9,arya stark,Who?
Episode 9,sansa stark,"No, stop! Please, someone stop him!"
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"My son, this is madness."
Episode 9,arya stark,Let me go.
Episode 9,sansa stark,"Stop him, stop!"
Episode 10,arya stark,l'm not a boy!
Episode 10,catelyn stark,Robb. Robb! You've ruined your sword.
Episode 10,catelyn stark,Shh! Shh! Shh!
Episode 10,robb stark,l'll kill them all. Every one of them. l will kill them all.
Episode 10,catelyn stark,My boy. They have your sisters. We have to get the girls back. And then we will kill them all.
Episode 10,sansa stark,"Thank you, my lord."
Episode 10,sansa stark,"No! Please, no!"
Episode 10,sansa stark,You promised to be merciful.
Episode 10,sansa stark,"Please let me go home. l won't do any treason, l swear –"
Episode 10,sansa stark,How long do l have to look?
Episode 10,sansa stark,lf it please Your Grace.
Episode 10,sansa stark,Or maybe he'll give me yours.
Episode 10,robb stark,Renly is not the king.
Episode 10,robb stark,"That doesn't make Renly king. He's Robert's youngest brother. lf Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell before me, Renly can't be king before Stannis."
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,"Am l your brother, now and always?"
Episode 10,robb stark,Now and always.
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,"My sword is yours in victory and defeat, from this day until my last day."
Episode 10,catelyn stark,l want to see him. Now! Leave us.
Episode 10,catelyn stark,Leave us.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,"You look lovely tonight, Lady Stark. Widowhood becomes you. Your bed must be lonely. ls that why you came? l'm not at my best, but l think l could be of service. You slip out of that gown and we'll see if l'm up to it. Oh, l do like a violent woman."
Episode 10,catelyn stark,"l will kill you tonight, Ser. Pack your head in a box and send it to your sister."
Episode 10,jaime lannister,"Let me show you how. Hit me again, over the ear. And again and again. You're stronger than you look, it shouldn't take long."
Episode 10,catelyn stark,"That is what you want the world to believe, isn't it? That you don't fear death."
Episode 10,jaime lannister,"But l don't, my lady. The dark is coming for all of us. Why cry about it?"
Episode 10,catelyn stark,"Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells, if the gods are just."
Episode 10,jaime lannister,What gods are those? The trees your husband prayed to? Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off? lf your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice?
Episode 10,catelyn stark,Because of men like you.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,There are no men like me. Only me.
Episode 10,catelyn stark,My son Bran. How did he come to fall from that tower?
Episode 10,jaime lannister,l pushed him out the window.
Episode 10,catelyn stark,Why?
Episode 10,jaime lannister,I hoped the fall would kill him.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,You should get some sleep. lt's going to be a long war.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Stop talking. Get back into bed.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,They have my son.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,The Stark boy appears to be less green than we'd hoped.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,There's your peace. Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Stark's head. You'll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now. He's winning – in case you hadn't noticed.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,"They have my son! Get out, all of you. Not you. You were right about Eddard Stark. lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now – madness. Madness and stupidity. l always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps l was wrong."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"Half wrong. l'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here."
Episode 10,tywin lannister,No one will stay here. Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from Godo s Eye to the Red Fork. The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. And you will go to King's Landing.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,And do what?
Episode 10,tywin lannister,"Rule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest – Baelish, Varys, Pycelle…"
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?"
Episode 10,tywin lannister,"You're my son. Oh, one more thing. You will not take that whore to court. Do you understand?"
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,Ser Jorah?
Episode 10,jorah mormont,"Gently, gently."
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,My son – where is he? l want him. Where is he?
Episode 10,jorah mormont,The boy did not live.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,Tell me.
Episode 10,jorah mormont,What is there to tell?
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,How did my son die?
Episode 10,jorah mormont,"He never lived, my princess. The women say –"
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,What do the women say?
Episode 10,jorah mormont,They say the child was –
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me. Show me what l bought with my son's life.
Episode 10,jorah mormont,Time enough for that later –
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,l want to see him now.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,The khalasar is gone.
Episode 10,jorah mormont,"A khal who cannot ride is no khal. The Dothraki follow only the strong. l'm sorry, my Princess."
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,Drogo! My sun and stars. Why is he out here alone?
Episode 10,jorah mormont,"He seems to like the warmth, Princess."
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,This is not life. When will he be as he was?
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,Leave us.
Episode 10,jorah mormont,l don't want you alone with this sorceress.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,l have nothing more to fear from this woman. Go.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,You knew what l was buying and you knew the price.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,This is not Godo s work. My child was innocent.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,l spoke for you. l saved you.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,Your life.
Episode 10,jon snow,"Get out of my way, Sam."
Episode 10,jon snow,Better than you do.
Episode 10,jon snow,l'm gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat.
Episode 10,jon snow,Move.
Episode 10,jon snow,Hyah!
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,So it would seem.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"No, he said l couldn't take with me to King's Landing. He was very specific on that point."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,What?
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"l believe he used the word ""whore""."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. He's always been a cunt. l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. Why don't you come with me, be the Hando s lady? Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand –"
Episode 10,jon snow,Ghost?
Episode 10,jon snow,l belong with my brother.
Episode 10,jon snow,They'll kill you if they know you came after me. Go back.
Episode 10,jon snow,l have to.
Episode 10,jon snow,I don't care about –
Episode 10,jon snow,To hell with all of you.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,"Do you remember our first ride, my sun and stars? lf you are in there, if you haven't gone away, show me. You're a fighter. You've always been a fighter. l need you to fight now. l know you're very far away, but come back to me, my sun and stars."
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,"When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east. Then you shall return to me, my sun and stars."
Episode 10,varys,"When you imagine yourself up there, how do you look? Does the crown fit? Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow, the ones who sneered at you for years?"
Episode 10,petyr baelish,lt's hard for them to simper and bow without heads.
Episode 10,varys,A man with great ambition and no morals… l wouldn't bet against you.
Episode 10,petyr baelish,"And what would you do, my friend, if you found yourself sitting up there?"
Episode 10,varys,l must be one of the few men in this city who doesn't want to be King.
Episode 10,petyr baelish,You must be one of the few men in the city who isn't a man.
Episode 10,varys,"Oh, you can do better than that."
Episode 10,petyr baelish,"When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones? l've always wondered."
Episode 10,varys,Have you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs?
Episode 10,petyr baelish,l picture a gash. Like a woman's. ls that about right?
Episode 10,varys,"l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all."
Episode 10,petyr baelish,"Must be strange for you, even after all these years… a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all."
Episode 10,varys,Am l? That is good to know. Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?
Episode 10,petyr baelish,But you carry on whispering in one king's ear and then the next. l admire you.
Episode 10,varys,"And l admire you, Lord Baelish. A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men – and women."
Episode 10,petyr baelish,"A useful talent, l'm sure you'd agree."
Episode 10,varys,So here we stand in mutual admiration and respect.
Episode 10,petyr baelish,Playing our roles.
Episode 10,varys,Serving a new King.
Episode 10,petyr baelish,Long may he reign. My king.
Episode 10,varys,My king.
Episode 10,arya stark,Arry.
Episode 10,arya stark,You want it? l'll give it to you. l already killed one fat boy. l bet you never killed anyone. l bet you're a liar. But l'm not. l'm good at killing fat boys. l like killing fat boys.
Episode 10,arya stark,lt was a gift.
Episode 10,arya stark,Which are you?
Episode 10,jon snow,My friends brought me back.
Episode 10,jon snow,They killed my father.
Episode 10,jon snow,No.
Episode 10,jon snow,Beyond the Wall?
Episode 10,jorah mormont,Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands. Sell them. You can return to the Free Cities and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,They were not given to me to sell.
Episode 10,jorah mormont,"Khaleesi, my Queen, l vow to serve you, obey you, to die for you if need be, but let him go, Khaleesi. l know what you intend. Do not."
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,l must. You don't understand.
Episode 10,jorah mormont,Don't ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre. l won't watch you burn.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,"ls that what you fear? You will be my khalasar. l see the faces of slaves. l free you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one will stop you. But if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters, as husbands and wives."
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,"Ser Jorah, bind this woman to the pyre. You swore to obey me."
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,I will. But it is not your screams I want. Only your life.
Episode 10,jorah mormont,Blood of my blood.
Episode 1,sansa stark,"It was well struck, Your Grace."
Episode 1,sansa stark,"Yes, Your Grace."
Episode 1,sansa stark,You can't!
Episode 1,sansa stark,I only meant… it would be bad luck to kill a man on your name day.
Episode 1,sansa stark,He is. A fool - you're so clever to see it. He'll make a much better fool than a knight. He doesn't deserve the mercy of a quick death.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Beloved nephew.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,We looked for you on the battlefield. . You were nowhere to be found.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"What a fine job you've done. . Look at you. . More beautiful than ever. . And you! You, you're going to be bigger than the Hound, but much better looking. . This one doesn't like me."
Episode 1,bronn,Can't imagine why.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Me, too, dear. Death is so boring, especially now with so much excitement in the world. . My Lady, I'm sorry for your loss."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,But still her father. Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize.
Episode 1,sansa stark,"My father was a traitor. My mother and brother are traitors, too. I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Of course you are.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Well, , enjoy your name day, Your Grace. Wish I could stay and celebrate, but there is work to be done."
Episode 1,varys,"The peasants say, a long summer means an even longer winter."
Episode 1,petyr baelish,"We have enough wheat for a five-year winter. If it lasts any longer, , we'll have fewer peasants."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"You command the City Watch, do you not, Lord Slynt?"
Episode 1,cersei lannister,And are you not a Lord at my command?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"Then do your job. Shut the gates to the peasants. They belong in the field, not our capital."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Don't get up. More ravishing than ever, big sister. . War agrees with you. Forgive the interruption, carry on."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,What are you doing here?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"It's been a remarkable journey. I, , pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell. . I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,What are you doing here? This is the small council.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Yes., well, I, do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Our father is Hand of the King.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Yes, but in his absence…"
Episode 1,varys,Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights -
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Out! All of you out. . I would like to know how you tricked father into this.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"If I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. ."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,I've done nothing.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,I tried to stop it.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Robb Stark is a child.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Who's won every battle he's fought. Do you understand we're losing the war?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,What do you know about warfare?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Nothing. But I know people. And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Joffrey is King.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Joffrey is King.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,You are here to advise him.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"I'm only here to advise him. And if the King listens to what I say, the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,How?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,One.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,One?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"Arya, little animal, she disappeared."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child."
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,He said they ate meat.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,My brother didn't know anything about dragons. He didn't know anything about anything.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,She was Drogo's first gift to me.
Episode 1,jorah mormont,I remember.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,I promised to protect them. Promised them their enemies would die screaming. How do I make starvation scream?
Episode 1,jorah mormont,"A trick I never learned, I'm afraid."
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Does it ever end?
Episode 1,jorah mormont,"This is further east than I've ever been. But, yes, Khaleesi, everything ends, even the red waste."
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,And you're sure there's no other way?
Episode 1,jorah mormont,"If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen, the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons. If we go west to the Dothraki Sea, the first Khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons."
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,No one will take my dragons.
Episode 1,jorah mormont,"They are too weak to fight, as are your people. You must be their strength."
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,As you are mine.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,"Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro. Take our remaining horses. You will ride east, you southeast, and you northeast."
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,"Cities, living or dead. Caravans and people. Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea. Find how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side."
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,"Rokharo, you are my last hope, blood of my blood."
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,You never have.
Episode 1,jon snow,Having a rough time of it?
Episode 1,sam,Nothing's killed me yet.
Episode 1,sam,You offered me a ride!
Episode 1,sam,Are those girls?
Episode 1,sam,I haven't seen a girl in six months.
Episode 1,sam,That's foul.
Episode 1,jon snow,What happens to the boys?
Episode 1,sam,Hmm?
Episode 1,jon snow,He marries his daughters. What does he do with his sons?
Episode 1,jon snow,We're not Southerners.
Episode 1,jon snow,Jon Snow.
Episode 1,jon snow,Lord commander.
Episode 1,jon snow,Your steward.
Episode 1,davos,Not now.
Episode 1,stannis baratheon,For the night is dark and full of terror.
Episode 1,davos,"Stannis is our king. We follow where he leads, even if we don't like the path."
Episode 1,davos,I don't serve the others. I serve Stannis.
Episode 1,davos,What's the truth?
Episode 1,stannis baratheon,"He wasn't my beloved brother. . I didn't love him, he didn't love me."
Episode 1,davos,"A harmless courtesy, Your Grace."
Episode 1,stannis baratheon,A lie. Take it out.
Episode 1,stannis baratheon,"Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Call him what he is."
Episode 1,stannis baratheon,"Make it Ser Jaime Lannister, the Kingslayer. Whatever else he is, the man's still a knight."
Episode 1,stannis baratheon,"When Eddard Stark learned the truth, he told only me. I'll not make the same mistake. Send copies of that letter to every corner of the Realm, from the Arbor to the Wall. The time has come to choose. Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse."
Episode 1,davos,"Your Grace, the Lannisters are the true enemy. If, for the time being, you could make peace with your brother -"
Episode 1,stannis baratheon,I'll not make peace with Renly while he calls himself King.
Episode 1,davos,"Well, many have already declared for him; Mace Tyrell, Randyll Tarly."
Episode 1,davos,And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet?
Episode 1,davos,"I'm sure he doesn't, but we do if we're going to war. If not Renly, Your Grace, join forces with Robb Stark."
Episode 1,stannis baratheon,"Who would steal the northern half of my kingdom. I've always served thieves according to their desserts, as you well know, Ser Davos. Joffrey, Renly, Robb Stark, they're all thieves. They'll bend the knee or I'll destroy them."
Episode 1,davos,Don't.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"King in the North. I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping, but you drag me along from camp to camp. Have you grown fond of me, Stark? Is that it? I've never seen you with a girl."
Episode 1,robb stark,"If I left you with one of my bannermen, your father would know within a fortnight, and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message, ""Release my son and you'll be rich beyond your dreams. Refuse and your house will be destroyed, root and stem.”"
Episode 1,jaime lannister,You don't trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle?
Episode 1,robb stark,"Oh, I trust them with my life. Just not with yours."
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Smart boy. What's wrong? Don't like being called ‘boy'? Insulted?
Episode 1,robb stark,"You insult yourself, Kingslayer. You've been defeated by a boy."
Episode 1,robb stark,You're held captive by a boy. Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy. . Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros. King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon. . He's your bastard son.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"If that's true, Stannis is the rightful king. How convenient for him."
Episode 1,robb stark,My father learned the truth. That's why you had him executed.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.
Episode 1,robb stark,Your son killed him so the world wouldn't learn who fathered him. And you... you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,You have proof? Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives?
Episode 1,robb stark,I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well.
Episode 1,robb stark,"No, but he's starting to know me."
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Three victories don't make you a conqueror.
Episode 1,robb stark,It's better than three defeats.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"A bit corpsey, yes."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,I thought you wanted to come here.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,You can smell cum from the balcony?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,And so did the country.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Yes, well, you need to be careful. No one can know you're here."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"You can't trust anyone in King's Landing. They're all liars; good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Why do you think I am so little? I'm being, , crushed beneath the weight of all that truth."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Ned Stark actually slept on this, as if the poor man didn't suffer enough. One of the many changes we'll have to make around here."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Lord Baelish.
Episode 1,petyr baelish,Your Grace.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
Episode 1,petyr baelish,"Of course, Your Grace."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya... we can't seem to locate her.
Episode 1,petyr baelish,"If she's escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.
Episode 1,petyr baelish,Curious.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her, well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts."
Episode 1,petyr baelish,"Well, you could ask Varys where she is. He'll have an answer for you. Whether you believe it,,, Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs. Who knows what they want?"
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"A mockingbird. . You created your own Sigil, didn't you?"
Episode 1,petyr baelish,Yes.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Appropriate for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.
Episode 1,petyr baelish,I'm glad you like it. Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family. Others have to find their own way.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly, she had eyes for another."
Episode 1,petyr baelish,"When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise. Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections. And when these affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation, indeed. Especially in a prominent family. But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I've found."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,And which truth is that?
Episode 1,petyr baelish,Knowledge is power.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Seize him. . Cut his throat. . Stop. Wait. I've changed my mind. Let him go. . Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes. . Power is power. Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me. I would very much appreciate it.
Episode 1,robb stark,You're Ser Alton Lannister?
Episode 1,robb stark,"I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms. First, your family must release my sisters. Second, my father's bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell. And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned. Their families can honor them with proper funerals."
Episode 1,robb stark,"Third... Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North. From this time, till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom."
Episode 1,robb stark,"Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again. If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father, only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me."
Episode 1,robb stark,"These are my terms. If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace. If not, I will litter the south with Lannister dead."
Episode 1,robb stark,"Oh, is he? You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton. That will be all for tonight."
Episode 1,theon greyjoy,"A word, Your Grace?"
Episode 1,robb stark,You don't have to call me ‘Your Grace' when no one's around.
Episode 1,theon greyjoy,It's not so bad once you get used to it.
Episode 1,robb stark,I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.
Episode 1,theon greyjoy,"The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?"
Episode 1,robb stark,Of course they are.
Episode 1,theon greyjoy,"We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing. And we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships and men who know how to sail them."
Episode 1,robb stark,Men who fought my father.
Episode 1,theon greyjoy,"Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now. I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me. I know he will. I'm not a Stark. I know that. But your father raised me to be an honorable man. We can avenge him together."
Episode 1,catelyn stark,You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
Episode 1,robb stark,I need his ships. They say he has 200.
Episode 1,catelyn stark,They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing. Shall we rally them to fight for us?
Episode 1,robb stark,I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.
Episode 1,catelyn stark,I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy. Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.
Episode 1,robb stark,"Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne. Before me, it was father. You married one rebel and mothered another."
Episode 1,catelyn stark,"I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten."
Episode 1,robb stark,"If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet."
Episode 1,catelyn stark,"You want to leave Sansa in the Queen's hands? And Arya, I haven't heard a word about Arya. What are we fighting for if not for them?"
Episode 1,robb stark,It's more complicated than that! You know it is.
Episode 1,catelyn stark,It's time for me to go home. I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.
Episode 1,robb stark,You can't go to Winterfell.
Episode 1,catelyn stark,I beg your pardon?
Episode 1,robb stark,"I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys, ‘cause tomorrow, you'll ride south to the Stormlands."
Episode 1,catelyn stark,Why in the name of all the Gods -
Episode 1,robb stark,"Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon. He's rallied an army of 100,000. You know him. You know his family."
Episode 1,catelyn stark,I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy. You have a hundred other lords -
Episode 1,robb stark,"Which of these lords do I trust more than you? If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one. When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace. We'll get the girls back. Then we'll all go home for good."
Episode 1,catelyn stark,I will ride at first light.
Episode 1,robb stark,"We will all be together again soon, I promise."
Episode 1,catelyn stark,You've done so well. Your father would be proud.
Episode 1,robb stark,Give Lord Renly my regards.
Episode 1,catelyn stark,King Renly. There's a king in every corner now.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,What is all this?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,We can't find Arya Stark.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"Perhaps. But if not, we need her. They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,We need to set our armies to the task of finding her. Send out as many men as we can. I'm sure if you asked grandfather -
Episode 1,cersei lannister,His life is in danger.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Of course it is. No one believes this foul gossip -
Episode 1,cersei lannister,What are you asking?
Episode 2,cersei lannister,What are you doing here?
Episode 2,varys,Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as hand in his stead.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,You brought this on yourself.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,I've done nothing.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Do you understand we're losing the war?
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Does it ever end?
Episode 2,jorah mormont,"Everything ends, even the red waste."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"Rakharo, Aggo, Kovarro.. Take our remaining horses. Find out how far the Red Waste extends before us, and what lies on the other side."
Episode 2,jon snow,What happens to the boys? What does he do with his sons?
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,Send copies of that letter to every corner of the realm.
Episode 2,robb stark,I'm sending one of your cousins down to King's Landing with my peace terms.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,You think my father's going to negotiate with you? You don't know him very well.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,"We won't beat them until we take King's Landing, and we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships, and men who know how to sail them."
Episode 2,robb stark,Men who fought my father.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me.
Episode 2,catelyn stark,You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
Episode 2,robb stark,I need his ships.
Episode 2,catelyn stark,He is not trustworthy!
Episode 2,cersei lannister,What are you asking?
Episode 2,arya stark,What do you want?
Episode 2,arya stark,I have friends.
Episode 2,arya stark,You should have asked nicely.
Episode 2,arya stark,They don't scare me.
Episode 2,arya stark,What are gold cloaks doing this far from King's Landing?
Episode 2,arya stark,They're looking for me.
Episode 2,varys,My lord.
Episode 2,varys,We were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,It was quite a battle.
Episode 2,varys,I heard you suffered a terrible head wound. The northerners are such fearsome warriors.
Episode 2,varys,To find so lovely creature working in your father's kitchen. It almost beggars belief.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Strange things do happen. You should taste her fish pie.
Episode 2,varys,How can you tell?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Men like Lord Varys and I can't let our disadvantages get the best of us. We'll make a fisherman of him yet. .
Episode 2,varys,"I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital. Friends are such an important part of life. Unfortunate that your father didn't want her to come. But rest easy my lord, I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Your discretion is legendary, where your friends are concerned."
Episode 2,varys,"How unspeakable of me to go on and on, when all you want to do is rest. I will leave you. . Welcome to Kings Landing, my dear. The city is made brighter by your presence. We have a council meeting, my lord."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I don't like threats.
Episode 2,varys,Who threatened you?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I'm not Ned Stark. I understand the way this game is played.
Episode 2,varys,Ned Stark was a man of honor.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,And I am not. Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea.
Episode 2,varys,"You might be disappointed in the results. The storms come and go. The big fish eat the little fish. And I keep on paddling. Come, my lord. We shouldn't keep the queen waiting."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"From this time until the end of time, we are not part of your realm, but a free and independent Kingdom of the North.” . He has more spirit than his father, I'll give him that."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"You've perfected the art of tearing up papers. Give him his father's bones back, at least, as a gesture of good faith."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"You'll give the Starks our reply, cousin?"
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Did you see my brother when you were the Starks guest?
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"If you speak with him, tell him he's not been forgotten."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Safe travels, cousin."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,You have a deft hand with diplomacy.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,If that's everything?
Episode 2,varys,Trouble with the wildlings?
Episode 2,petyr baelish,That's why they're called wildlings.
Episode 2,varys,Somewhat less wild these days. It seems they've stopped killing each other and started following this King-Beyond-the-Wall.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"Another king? How many is that now, Five? I've lost count."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Perhaps he's forgotten we're fighting a war. We have no men to spare.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Cold winds are rising, and the dead rise with them."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"According to the Commander, one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers. . Mormont doesn't lie."
Episode 2,varys,How do you kill a dead man?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Apparently you burn him.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,One trip to The Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks. .
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"I don't know what I believe, but here's a fact for you. The Night's Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,I have every confidence the brave men of the Night's Watch will protect us all.
Episode 2,sam,"Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives. Wouldn't two, or three, be enough for him?"
Episode 2,sam,Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away.
Episode 2,sam,I'm sure that's nice too.
Episode 2,sam,You were with her? How many times?
Episode 2,sam,Wish I'd grew up on a farm.
Episode 2,sam,"Oh, oh. Right. I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure you weren't hurt. ."
Episode 2,jon snow,What're you doing?
Episode 2,sam,"This is Gilly, she's one of Craster's daughters."
Episode 2,jon snow,"Hello, Gilly. What're you doing?"
Episode 2,jon snow,"I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed to -"
Episode 2,sam,"She's pregnant. . We have to take her with us, when we leave."
Episode 2,jon snow,What? .
Episode 2,sam,I know it sounds a bit mad.
Episode 2,jon snow,"No it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible."
Episode 2,sam,"The Lord Commander, , we are sworn to protect -"
Episode 2,jon snow,Sam we can't take her -
Episode 2,jon snow,It's just not possible.
Episode 2,jon snow,"If it's a boy what? . You want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why."
Episode 2,sam,Why did you do that?
Episode 2,jon snow,"Do what, ask her a question?"
Episode 2,sam,You were cruel.
Episode 2,jon snow,Cruel! Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?
Episode 2,sam,I didn't touch her!
Episode 2,jon snow,No you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that?
Episode 2,sam,"I can't steal her, she's a person not a goat."
Episode 2,jon snow,"We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?"
Episode 2,sam,I could try. . What? I've read about it. A bit.
Episode 2,jon snow,"I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her."
Episode 2,jorah mormont,Khaleesi.
Episode 2,jorah mormont,You don't need to see this.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,He is blood of my blood.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Who did this?
Episode 2,jorah mormont,"Khal Pono perhaps, Khal Jhaqo They don't like the idea of a woman leading a Khalasaar."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,They will like it far less when I'm done with them.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Shh. They cannot kill his soul.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Shh. We will build him a funeral pyre.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"And I promise you, Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight."
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,Looks smaller.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,They'll be waiting for me on the docks.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,"Anyone who matters, , this is a big day for them. They haven't had much to get excited about since I left. It's a hard place the Iron Islands always has been. It's cold and it's wet."
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,"They say hard places breed hard men, , and hard men rule the world."
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,"Try smiling with your lips closed. . Hmm, better."
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,I don't blame him.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,"Quit talking about your father. He's right about us. Our wives from the Iron Islands, they're for breeding. That's not enough for us. That's why we take saltwives, from the women we capture."
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,Your place is on this ship.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,I haven't paid you.
Episode 2,petyr baelish,"One moment, my friend. A moment."
Episode 2,petyr baelish,Please accept my sincerest apologies. Ramka will take good care of you.
Episode 2,petyr baelish,Shhh. Did he hurt you?
Episode 2,petyr baelish,Who?
Episode 2,petyr baelish,"Ah, yes, that was poorly handled. Sometimes those with the most power have the least grace."
Episode 2,petyr baelish,"You know, you remind me of another girl. A lovely thing I once acquired from an Elysium pleasure house. Beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent as yourself. But she wasn't happy. She cried, often. I asked her why but, we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and I have. Yes, it was quite sad. Girls from Elysium pleasure houses are expensive. Extremely expensive. And this one wasn't making me any money. I hate bad investments. Really, I do. They haunt me. I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses. A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl. To use her in ways that never occur to most men. And you know what occurs to most men. I would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated. . Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen's child. I'll see you tomorrow. But you'll be happy? . That makes me happy."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Leave us, Podrick. I believe we know how to pour our own wine."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Myself, I prefer the improper ones."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"You know your wines, my lord."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Call me Tyrion, please. I'm sure you're getting used to fine dinners, now that you're a lord."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Wars have been started for less.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Yes, of course. City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Quite right. Especially the queen's orders.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"That's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,The fool! He had no idea you were already bought.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,The queen regent. And you're a fool to believe she's your friend.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"No, we shan't."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"There's a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight. From there, I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way."
Episode 2,bronn,"The lads will escort you. The streets aren't safe at night, my lord."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,His name is Bronn... and he is the new commander of the City Watch.
Episode 2,bronn,Boys?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,To the new Commander.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"If I told you to murder, an infant girl say, still at her mother's breast, would you do it without question?"
Episode 2,bronn,Without question? No. I'd ask how much.
Episode 2,arya stark,"If you got within a mile of a battle, you'd fill your pants."
Episode 2,arya stark,Liar.
Episode 2,arya stark,So?
Episode 2,arya stark,"Gendry's an armorer's apprentice. Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle."
Episode 2,arya stark,What do the gold cloaks want with you?
Episode 2,arya stark,You're a liar.
Episode 2,arya stark,Then I wouldn't get to insult anyone. .
Episode 2,arya stark,No goodo s ever come? Who asked questions before?
Episode 2,arya stark,Who asked questions?
Episode 2,arya stark,Lord Stark.
Episode 2,arya stark,What did they ask about?
Episode 2,arya stark,Who's your mom?
Episode 2,arya stark,And who was your father?
Episode 2,arya stark,I'm not a girl!
Episode 2,arya stark,"Stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that."
Episode 2,arya stark,I am not!
Episode 2,arya stark,I don't need to take a piss… Lommy and Hot Pie can't know. No one can know.
Episode 2,arya stark,My name's not Arry. It's Arya. Of House Stark. Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell.
Episode 2,arya stark,He was never a traitor! Joffrey is a liar.
Episode 2,arya stark,"No. I mean yes. My mother was a lady, and my sister -"
Episode 2,arya stark,Do not call me milady.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,Pears and oranges. Wine from the Arbor. And the heir to Pyke of the Iron Islands. . The only living son of Balon Greyjoy. . Me.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,I need to get to Pyke.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,I bet you can.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,None like you.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,You don't know what you're like. You need someone to teach you. Know who I am?
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,Have my things sent up to the castle.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,"You should give me the reins, I'm a better rider than you. I've been on horseback for the last nine years."
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,Don't you worry about my hands. . The sea's in my blood.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,"I have a proposal for my father. One that will make him king again. And me after him. You may stay at the castle tonight, if you're lucky."
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,"An order, from your future king. You can tell your grandchildren about this night."
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,Father.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,A man. Your blood and your heir.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,Lord Stark is gone.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,What's done is done. I've brought you a proposal from Robb Stark.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,"If my clothes offend you, I will change them."
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,Gold.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,My blood is salt and iron.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,"The offer he makes, is one I proposed."
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,"I've lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side, he thinks of me as a brother."
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,I forget nothing. I remember my brothers. And I remember when my father was a king.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,I will lead the attack myself.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,I'm your son. Your only living heir. Who else?
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,I told you to wait outside. . How did you get past the guards?
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,Yara?
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,She can't lead an attack!
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,You're a woman!
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,You won't stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own.
Episode 2,davos,You'll have your gold when we take the treasury at King's Landing.
Episode 2,davos,"Because you're a smart gambler. Stannis has proved himself in war. Twice. His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield. Neither has the false king, Joffrey."
Episode 2,davos,Stannis has just begun the fight. His bannermen will rally to his cause. There's no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honorable than Stannis Baratheon. Or more worthy of loyalty.
Episode 2,davos,Matthos.
Episode 2,davos,"Of course you do. Every time you leave harbor, you're leaving on a promise. A promise that somewhere on the seas, somebody's got some gold and you can take it from them."
Episode 2,davos,"As is mine. You're not the young man, Salladhor. And correct me if I'm wrong"
Episode 2,davos,"You want to spend your last few years on the sea, stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Midanese silk merchants, then go. They're out there waiting for you. That's easy. What I'm offering you is hard. Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros. You'll be the richest man in Lysene. And the most famous. They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing."
Episode 2,davos,It is. .
Episode 2,davos,The queen?
Episode 2,davos,He's young yet. I promise you the gold. I promise you the glory. I cannot promise you the queen.
Episode 2,davos,He is the one true king.
Episode 2,davos,Get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will.
Episode 2,davos,As soon as his God wills it.
Episode 2,davos,Oh you and your mother.
Episode 2,davos,"I wish I had a God, truly! I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every God there is. Pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home. None of it works!"
Episode 2,davos,I wasn't praying.
Episode 2,davos,"You want me to have a god, fine. King Stannis is my god. He raised me up and blessed me with his trust. He gave you a future I could never have imagined. You know how to read, you'll be a knight someday. You think your fire god commanded all that? It was Stannis. Only Stannis."
Episode 2,davos,Don't tell him that.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I have every right. I am the King's Hand.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,You're serving as the King's Hand until father gets here. I am Queen Regent.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?"
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"Ha, the people. You think I care?"
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, “The Queen slaughters babies.” . You don't even have the decency to deny it."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"He did what needed to be done. . You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. . It's all fallen on me."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"You're funny. . You've always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,She was my mother too.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"Now they're gone, for the sake of you. There's no bigger joke in the world than that. ."
Episode 2,davos,Your Grace.
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,How did it fare with your pirate?
Episode 2,davos,Salladhor Saan will join our fleet. 30 ships. His men know how to fight.
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,"In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men."
Episode 2,davos,Does seem the wiser choice.
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,It won't be a choice this time. Do you trust him?
Episode 2,davos,"Salladhor Saan is an old friend, I've known him 30 years. I've never trusted him."
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,"Well if he does his job, he'll have his share. Leave us."
Episode 2,davos,"At once, Your Grace."
Episode 2,davos,Come.
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,What did you say to him?
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,Why?
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,Yeah.
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,Tell your lord to burn them then.
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,My little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts. Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,"Faith? In a real war, the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten."
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,"I cannot defeat my brother in the field, and I can't take King's Landing without the men he stole."
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,"I've said the words, damn you! I burnt the idols."
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,I have a wife. I took a vow.
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,A son?
Episode 3,jon snow,Lord Commander-
Episode 3,sam,Lord Commander-
Episode 3,jon snow,"I followed him. He took the baby into the woods, the newborn."
Episode 3,jon snow,"No, you don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys..."
Episode 3,jon snow,You know.
Episode 3,jon snow,Offerings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.
Episode 3,jon snow,I... I saw it. I saw... something take that child.
Episode 3,sam,Gilly.
Episode 3,sam,"I, I wanted to give you something. It belonged to my mother."
Episode 3,sam,Please. I want you to. My mother used it for sewing. She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and I'd read to her. My father put a stop to it when he found out. It's the only thing I have of hers. She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.
Episode 3,sam,I'm not giving it away. I'm giving it to you.
Episode 3,sam,Keep it safe for me. Til I come back.
Episode 3,brienne,"Your Grace, I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard."
Episode 3,brienne,"I will be one of your seven, pledge my life to yours, and keep you safe from all harm."
Episode 3,catelyn stark,Lord of Winterfell and King in the North.
Episode 3,catelyn stark,You are most kind.
Episode 3,catelyn stark,"It will be enough to know that justice was done, my lord."
Episode 3,brienne,Your Grace. And you should kneel when you approach the King.
Episode 3,catelyn stark,"I do not sit on my son's war councils. And if I did, I would not share his strategies with you."
Episode 3,catelyn stark,"My son is fighting a war, not playing at one."
Episode 3,catelyn stark,"And all of them young and bold like your Knight of Flowers? It's a game to you, isn't it? I pity them."
Episode 3,catelyn stark,Because it won't last. Because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming.
Episode 3,brienne,"At once, Your Grace. Shall I return after?"
Episode 3,brienne,"If you'll follow me, my lady."
Episode 3,catelyn stark,"You fought bravely today, Lady Brienne."
Episode 3,brienne,"I fought for my king. Soon I'll fight for him on the battlefield. Die for him if I must. And, if it please you, Brienne's enough. I'm no lady."
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,What are you doing here?
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,You lying bitch.
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,Recognize you? How could I? The last time I saw you- you looked like a fat little boy.
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,Why didn't you tell me?
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,Father.
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,And what's my role in all this?
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,A ship? You give her thirty and I get one?
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,I'm to fight fishermen?
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,"Father, I fought with Robb Stark. I know his men. He won't give up the North so easily."
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,"What do you know of it, woman? I'm a proven warrior."
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,"I'm not protecting anyone. I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait. Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies? Rise up against them and they could destroy us. But if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock."
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,We do not sow.
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,"You act as if I volunteered to go. You gave me away, if you remember. The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon. After he crushed you. Did you take what was yours then?"
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,You gave me away!
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,Your boy! Your last boy! You gave me away like I was some dog you didn't want anymore. And now you curse me because I've come home.
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,I have no other family.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Keep your voice down.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,I don't intend for you to stay here. I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Again, only temporary."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,But you wouldn't be a cook. You'd pose as a scullion.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Kitchen wench.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Yes, but-"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Your lion wants to see you alive. We've come to a dangerous place. My sister wants to hurt me. She'll look for any weakness she can find. She can't know about you.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"It's a compliment, my lady."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Language can be a bit tricky here.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"Soon, darling, when the war is over."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,The princess just spoke to you.
Episode 3,sansa stark,"Pardon, Your Grace. I'm sure your dress will be beautiful, Myrcella. I'm counting the days until the fighting is done and I can pledge my love to the King in sight of the gods."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,He might.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Would you like that?
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"Even if he does, Sansa will do her duty. Won't you, little dove?"
Episode 3,sansa stark,Come in.
Episode 3,sansa stark,Who are you?
Episode 3,sansa stark,I didn't know I needed a new handmaiden. You're not from here.
Episode 3,sansa stark,What are you doing?
Episode 3,sansa stark,I shouldn't have to tell you to do things. You should just do them.
Episode 3,sansa stark,"Change my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair."
Episode 3,sansa stark,No.
Episode 3,sansa stark,Not now.
Episode 3,sansa stark,Clean the table.
Episode 3,sansa stark,Have you ever been a handmaiden before?
Episode 3,sansa stark,For whom?
Episode 3,sansa stark,Lady Zuriff
Episode 3,sansa stark,There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.
Episode 3,sansa stark,"I don't know how they did things in that city, but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies, not the other way around. And I don't have time to answer a thousand questions and teach you how to do your job."
Episode 3,sansa stark,Just brush my hair.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Oh! Thank the gods. I haven't had a proper shit in six days.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Please.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"But remember, the Queen mustn't know."
Episode 3,varys,"Ooh. ""The Queen mustn't know."" I love conversations that begin this way."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.
Episode 3,varys,"Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell. He fights for Robb Stark."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Precisely.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"But remember, you must tell no one."
Episode 3,petyr baelish,Tell no one what?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,She imprisoned you. She tried to execute you. And you offer her son a princess?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?"
Episode 3,petyr baelish,And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Who better?
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold... and Harrenhal."
Episode 3,petyr baelish,Harrenhal is cursed.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands."
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,You served my family well in the matter of the succession.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too. Until you snatched it away."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then?"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Good. Oh. And remember-
Episode 3,petyr baelish,The Queen mustn't know.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,You monster. Myrcella is my only daughter. Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Myrcella's a princess. Some would say she was born for this.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Dorne is the safest place for her.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,She'll be a hostage.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,A guest.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"You won't get away with this. You think the piece of paper Father gave you keeps you safe. Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"It's done, Cersei."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,No.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,You cannot stop it.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,No!
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Get out! Get out!
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,I would.
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,What is dead may never die.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf. If Myrcella marries the Martell boy, she can't very well marry Robin Arryn, can she?"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"No, afraid not. Sorry about that."
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"And Harrenhal, I suppose that's off the table as well."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too."
Episode 3,petyr baelish,Leave me out of your next deception.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Oh, that's a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade. I would see him released. That's where you come in."
Episode 3,petyr baelish,Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"No, he won't. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Find him?
Episode 3,bronn,"Oh, aye. And he has company. Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"No, you don't."
Episode 3,bronn,"No, I don't."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"You disappoint me, Grand Maester."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Well, make do."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,How long have you been spying for my sister?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,I don't like his beard.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,So you poisoned him?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"But you let him die, made sure he succumbed."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,For your trouble.
Episode 3,varys,You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Good. One of my better ideas.
Episode 3,varys,And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell?
Episode 3,varys,"Well played, My Lord Hand. But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle - The Small Council grows smaller every day."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.
Episode 3,varys,"Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Why, am I about to hear one?"
Episode 3,varys,"Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies?"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Depends on the sellsword.
Episode 3,varys,Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"He has a sword, the power of life and death."
Episode 3,varys,"But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,I've decided I don't like riddles.
Episode 3,varys,"Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow."
Episode 3,arya stark,I can't sleep.
Episode 3,arya stark,I don't like the taste.
Episode 3,arya stark,How do you sleep?
Episode 3,arya stark,"But you've seen things, horrible things."
Episode 3,arya stark,How do you sleep when you... when you have those things in your head?
Episode 3,arya stark,"I close my eyes and I see them up there. All of them standing there. Joffrey, the Queen and... and my sister."
Episode 3,arya stark,Get up.
Episode 3,arya stark,"No, I'm not afraid."
Episode 4,robb stark,"We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton."
Episode 4,robb stark,I doubt it.
Episode 4,robb stark,My father outlawed flaying in the North.
Episode 4,robb stark,We're not torturing them.
Episode 4,robb stark,The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own. I won't give them an excuse to abuse my sisters.
Episode 4,robb stark,You'll die if she doesn't.
Episode 4,robb stark,Put this in your mouth and lie down. You don't want to watch.
Episode 4,robb stark,"Bite on it. It's better than biting your own tongue, believe me."
Episode 4,robb stark,What's your name?
Episode 4,robb stark,Your last name?
Episode 4,robb stark,You know my family name. You have me at a disadvantage.
Episode 4,robb stark,They killed my father.
Episode 4,robb stark,The family he fights for.
Episode 4,robb stark,I have no hatred for the lad.
Episode 4,robb stark,"You'd have us surrender, end all this bloodshed. I understand. The country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey."
Episode 4,robb stark,If the gods give me strength.
Episode 4,robb stark,I don't know. We'll go back to Winterfell. I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.
Episode 4,robb stark,I don't know.
Episode 4,robb stark,First we have to win the war.
Episode 4,robb stark,You never told me where you're from.
Episode 4,robb stark,Volantis? You're far from home. The boy was lucky you were here.
Episode 4,sansa stark,"Your Grace, whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part. You know that. I beg you, please"
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,What is the meaning of this?
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,What kind of knight beats a helpless girl?
Episode 4,bronn,"Careful, now. We don't want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,Someone get the girl something to cover herself with. She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor?
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"I'm not threatening the king, ser. I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference?"
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,I apologize for my nephew's behavior. Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement?
Episode 4,sansa stark,"I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Lady Stark, you may survive us yet."
Episode 4,bronn,The little king's backed up. Clogged from balls to brains.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?
Episode 4,bronn,There's no cure for being a cunt. But the boy's at that age. And he's got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies. Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,Your Grace.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,I'm a practical man.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,And who would you have me be loyal to? Your brother's corpse?
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"You still have many friends at court, Your Grace, many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim."
Episode 4,petyr baelish,I would give priority to my head.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"I understand that you don't like me, and while that saddens me greatly, I did not come here today seeking your affection. When you march on King's Landing, you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or open gates."
Episode 4,petyr baelish,All of these tents look the same to me. Would you be so kind-
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"Your tent""? Not ""Our tent""? The king snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers solitude? Pressures of command, no doubt. Four kings vying for the throne."
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"If war were arithmetic, the mathematicians would rule the world. I did notice your brother entering His Grace's tent just now."
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"And on the night of your wedding, who was by the king's side then?"
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"Your marriage is quite interesting. Not only to me, but to the realm. The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else."
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly."
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,This isn't your horse.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Qarth?
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Will they let us in?
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,What do you know of this place?
Episode 4,jorah mormont,"Only that the desert around their walls is called the Garden of Bones. Every time the Qartheen shut their gates on a traveler, the garden grows."
Episode 4,arya stark,Dragonfire.
Episode 4,arya stark,Dead people.
Episode 4,arya stark,Does anyone live?
Episode 4,arya stark,Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound. Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.
Episode 4,catelyn stark,How dare you?
Episode 4,petyr baelish,You may have heard false reports.
Episode 4,catelyn stark,You betrayed Ned.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,Betrayed? I wanted him to serve as Protector of the Realm. I begged him to seize the moment.
Episode 4,catelyn stark,I trusted you. My husband trusted you. And you repaid our faith with treachery.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"No, my lady."
Episode 4,catelyn stark,Get out!
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"Cat, I've I've loved you since I was a boy. It seems to me that fate has given us this chance"
Episode 4,catelyn stark,Have you lost your mind? Get out!
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"Do you want to see your girls again? Sansa, more beautiful than ever? And Arya, just as wild as ever?"
Episode 4,catelyn stark,"You have Arya, too?"
Episode 4,petyr baelish,Both girls are healthy and safe. For now. But you know the Queen and you know Joffrey. I fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital.
Episode 4,catelyn stark,What do you want?
Episode 4,petyr baelish,The Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer.
Episode 4,catelyn stark,Of course they will. Jaime Lannister for two girls? Robb will never agree to those terms.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,I'm not bringing these terms to him. I'm bringing them to you.
Episode 4,catelyn stark,You think I keep secrets from my son?
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"Robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle, but he's not a mother. Consider it, Cat. You may not get another chance. I've brought you a gift."
Episode 4,catelyn stark,I don't want your gifts. A token of Tyrion Lannister's goodwill. He wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners is offered in good faith.
Episode 4,catelyn stark,Good faith?
Episode 4,catelyn stark,What's this?
Episode 4,petyr baelish,Your husband was an honorable man. He should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath Winterfell. You may not believe
Episode 4,catelyn stark,Get out.
Episode 4,arya stark,The Mountain. What are you doing?
Episode 4,arya stark,Joffrey. Cersei. llyn Payne. The Hound.
Episode 4,arya stark,Polliver. The Mountain.
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,"Lady Stark, I had not thought to find you in the Stormlands."
Episode 4,catelyn stark,"I had not thought to be here, Lord Stannis."
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,Who else might it be?
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,My own.
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,"Watch yourself, Renly."
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,That's twice I've warned you.
Episode 4,catelyn stark,"Listen to yourselves. If you were sons of mine, I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers."
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,"It is strange to find you beside my brother, Lady Stark. Your husband was a supporter of my claim. Lord Eddardo s integrity cost him his head. And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me."
Episode 4,catelyn stark,We share a common enemy.
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,The Iron Throne is mine by right. All those that deny that are my foes.
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,"For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider. Strike your banners, come to me before dawn, and I will grant you your old seat in the Council. I'll even name you my heir until a son is born to me. Otherwise I shall destroy you."
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,You think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,"We shall see, Renly. Come the dawn, we shall see."
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,I thought we were welcome.
Episode 4,jorah mormont,"If you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city, you might do the same, Khaleesi."
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Horde?
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,My name is Daenerys-
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"You know me, my lord?"
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,And what should I call you?
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,The beauty of Quarth is legendary-
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Qarth.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"My friend, we have traveled very far. We have no food, no water. Once I see my people fed, I would be honored"
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,I am not a liar.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates."
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,What are you doing? You promised to receive me.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"If you do not let us in, all of us will die."
Episode 4,jorah mormont,"Khaleesi, please be careful."
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me. We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground. Turn us away and we will burn you first."
Episode 4,tywin lannister,What's this?
Episode 4,tywin lannister,Evidently not. Why are these prisoners not in their cells?
Episode 4,tywin lannister,Are we so well-manned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers?
Episode 4,tywin lannister,"You, do you have a trade?"
Episode 4,tywin lannister,"He'll do no such thing. This one's a girl, you idiot, dressed as a boy. Why?"
Episode 4,arya stark,"Safer to travel, my lord."
Episode 4,tywin lannister,Smart. More than I can say for this lot. Get these prisoners to work. Bring the girl. I need a new cupbearer.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Your visits are too few, cousin."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,So it is. Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself. Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that?"
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,And you've waited this long to deliver the information?
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Ah. Lavender oil. She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"An anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?"
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight?"
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Did he tell you to fuck her, too?"
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"No, I think not."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything. And you will tell me."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Oh, rise, rise. Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it's all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I'll give her Pycelle."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Yes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length."
Episode 4,davos,Your Grace.
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,Do your knuckle bones bring you luck?
Episode 4,davos,"Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace. And it's four less fingernails to clean."
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,Fewer.
Episode 4,davos,Pardon?
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,Four fewer fingernails to clean. Never understood why you had to wear them.
Episode 4,davos,It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now. It reminds me of your justice. It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver.
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,"You were a hero and a smuggler. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good."
Episode 4,davos,A lesson I've tried to teach my son.
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,Does he listen?
Episode 4,davos,"To me? Gods, no. But if your Red Woman told him to leap from the crow's nest"
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,She has a name. I trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks.
Episode 4,davos,I've lived within the law for seventeen-
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,I want you to be a smuggler this time.
Episode 4,davos,"Any shore, any night. What am I bringing ashore?"
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,The Red Woman. No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again.
Episode 4,davos,"I am true to Your Grace and always will be, but surely there are other ways, cleaner ways."
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,Cleaner ways don't win wars.
Episode 4,davos,Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors.
Episode 4,davos,"I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad."
Episode 4,davos,And which are you?
Episode 4,davos,"Well, that must be very nice for you."
Episode 4,davos,I do.
Episode 4,davos,Don't talk about my wife.
Episode 4,davos,Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows.
Episode 4,davos,These weren't here before. They've barred the passage.
Episode 4,davos,Gods protect us.
Episode 5,catelyn stark,By the mother. My son has no interest in the Iron Throne.
Episode 5,catelyn stark,And the wording of this oath?
Episode 5,catelyn stark,And in return for my son's loyalty?
Episode 5,catelyn stark,"Our two houses have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle. Negotiate a peace with your brother."
Episode 5,brienne,No! No.
Episode 5,catelyn stark,"No, wait, it wasn't her!"
Episode 5,catelyn stark,We've got to leave. They'll hang you for this.
Episode 5,brienne,I won't leave him.
Episode 5,catelyn stark,You can't avenge him if you're dead.
Episode 5,brienne,Not that way.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"My lord, my lady."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"Stannis will be here in an hour. When he arrives, Renly's bannermen will flock to him. Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"You will note that I am standing here talking to you, not Stannis."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,Stannis.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world?"
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today. You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground. If it is justice that you want, be smart about it."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"He was, Your Grace."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,Do you want to be a queen?
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Killed? By whom?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Accounts differ. Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Really? Who'd have thought?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard, while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour."
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"Whomever did it, I say well done."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"It's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea."
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money. Stannis Baratheon is coming for us, sooner rather than later."
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"Aren't there other things you should be doing, like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away?"
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,She'll be safer in Dorne.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"Yes, I know how concerned you are for her safety."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"It so happens that I am. Myrcella is a sweet, innocent girl and I don't blame her at all for you."
Episode 5,cersei lannister,So clever. Aren't you always so clever with your schemes and your plots?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Schemes and plots are the same thing. They are going to attack us. We need to be ready.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,No need to concern yourself over it. The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,It's important that we talk about this.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,It's the king's royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?"
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,MThat's a lie right there.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,The smart money would be on more likely.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,I suppose there's only one way to find out.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,When did she tell you this?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Swear to me on what?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,But I don't care about your life.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"All right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"Oh, Lancel, tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me."
Episode 5,bronn,It will be my pleasure.
Episode 5,davos,Your Grace.
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,What is it?
Episode 5,davos,"I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace, I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him."
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,"Fools love a fool. I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be."
Episode 5,davos,I need to speak to you - about what I saw in that cave.
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,I thought I made it clear to you there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter.
Episode 5,davos,"Your Grace, I-"
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,I've never known you to need to hear a thing twice.
Episode 5,davos,And I've never known you to hide from the truth.
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,You've come to lecture me on truth?
Episode 5,davos,I've come to tell you that what I saw.
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,"All my brother's bannermen have come to my side. Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards. They won't be able to resist us now. Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne."
Episode 5,davos,"Nothing is worth what this will cost you, not even the Iron"
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,I'll hear no more about it.
Episode 5,davos,When do we sail for King's Landing?
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,"As soon as I've consolidated my troops. We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet. Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city."
Episode 5,davos,And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,That's not your concern.
Episode 5,davos,"If you take King's Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers."
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,I never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?
Episode 5,davos,Loyal service means telling hard truths.
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,"Oh, truth again. All right, what's the truth? The hard truth?"
Episode 5,davos,She's a foreigner preaching her foreign religion. Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey.
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,What do you believe?
Episode 5,davos,You won those bannermen from Renly. Don't lose them to her.
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,We set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre. And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.
Episode 5,davos,"Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them. The other lords won't be happy."
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,"Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason. Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"Stannis has more infantry, more ships, more horses. What do we have?"
Episode 5,bronn,There's that mind of yours you keep going on about.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it."
Episode 5,bronn,Good thing. I'd be out of a job. What about your father?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"He hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,It's hard to argue with his assessment.
Episode 5,bronn,Not after what he did to your birthday present.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,The king is a lost cause. It's the rest of us I'm worried about now.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,You have to admire his imagination.
Episode 5,bronn,He's talking about you.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,What? Demon monkey?
Episode 5,bronn,People think you're pulling the king's strings. They blame you for the city's ills.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Blame me? I'm trying to save them.
Episode 5,bronn,You don't need to convince me.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Demon monkey.
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,You're the crew of the Sea Bitch? I'm your commander. Welcome.
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,Stop. Stop! Your captain commands you to stop!
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,"The Stony Shore, to raid their villages. There'll be spoils in it for you, and women, if you do your jobs well."
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,I do. Your captain.
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,"You could do that, take the ship, head out on your own. And I will hunt you down, drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor."
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,Thank you. Kind of you to come see me off.
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,You'd better get out there. Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,Who are you?
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,Why aren't you with the rest of them? Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea? That would be good for a laugh.
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,And yet that's the task my father has given me to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,"No, we could. We could never hold it for more than a few days. As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back. And then-"
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,Take me to my ship.
Episode 5,tywin lannister,The Starks understand winter better than we ever will. The cold won't beat them.
Episode 5,tywin lannister,"And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords. This is war, no one's content. We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long. He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him. And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North. You've been waiting for him to fail. He is not going to fail, not without our help. So how do we stop him?"
Episode 5,tywin lannister,"Yes, I think you would, Reginald. And because you're my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep. Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you."
Episode 5,tywin lannister,"Well, then you'd better start riding. Go, before I change my mind and send her your head."
Episode 5,tywin lannister,"If your name wasn't Lannister, you'd be scrubbing out pots in the cook's tent. Go!"
Episode 5,tywin lannister,"Not wine, water. We'll be here for some time. Girl, where are you from?"
Episode 5,arya stark,"Maidenpool, my lord."
Episode 5,tywin lannister,And who are the Lords of Maidenpool? Remind me.
Episode 5,arya stark,"House Mooton, my lord."
Episode 5,tywin lannister,And what is their sigil?
Episode 5,tywin lannister,"A red salmon. I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that. You're a Northerner, aren't you?"
Episode 5,tywin lannister,"Good. One more time, where are you from?"
Episode 5,arya stark,"Barrowton, my lord. House Dustin. Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown."
Episode 5,tywin lannister,And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?
Episode 5,arya stark,They call him the Young Wolf.
Episode 5,tywin lannister,And?
Episode 5,arya stark,They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf. They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants. They say he can't be killed.
Episode 5,tywin lannister,And do you believe them?
Episode 5,arya stark,"No, my lord. Anyone can be killed."
Episode 5,tywin lannister,Fetch that water.
Episode 5,arya stark,I was always a girl.
Episode 5,arya stark,You're one of them now. I should have let you burn.
Episode 5,arya stark,I didn't have a choice.
Episode 5,arya stark,Three what?
Episode 5,arya stark,I can name anyone and you'll kill him?
Episode 5,arya stark,The one who tortures everyone.
Episode 5,arya stark,I don't know his name. They call him the Tickler.
Episode 5,jon snow,When will he come?
Episode 5,jon snow,My uncle told me stories about him.
Episode 5,jon snow,I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.
Episode 5,jon snow,So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.
Episode 5,sam,"Beautiful, isn't it? Gilly would love it here."
Episode 5,sam,"The Fist of the First Men. Think of how old this place is. Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals, before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men."
Episode 5,sam,"Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we're standing all through the long night. What do you think they were like, the First Men?"
Episode 5,jon snow,I think they were afraid. I think they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked.
Episode 5,jon snow,One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts.
Episode 5,sam,"And three for White Walkers. It's been a thousand years, but that's the only time they blow the horn three times."
Episode 5,sam,Well I read it in a book.
Episode 5,jon snow,Look. It's Qhorin Halfhand.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"I remember reading an old sailors' proverb, ""Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off. """
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,My companion takes issue.
Episode 5,bronn,If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit. No offense meant.
Episode 5,bronn,To do what?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,How much do you have?
Episode 5,bronn,"If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father."
Episode 5,bronn,"I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy. 'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us. Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,My friend remains unconvinced.
Episode 5,bronn,"Well, he's not living anymore. And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks."
Episode 5,bronn,This is a shit idea.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene. The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low. You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer. You'll be making it for me."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,Dracarys. Dracarys.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,He'll be able to feed himself from now on.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"Let him sleep, Doreah."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,He loves you.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you, my friend."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"The last time a rich man gave me a dress, he was selling me to Khal Drogo."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"Xaro is our host, but we know nothing about him. Men like to talk about other men when they're happy."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,It sounds wonderful.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,Please excuse me for a moment.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,What are they doing?
Episode 5,jorah mormont,"Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry. Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot. They can pry out the gems, the rest is pure gold. Very soft. He can chop off as much as we can carry."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,We are his guests! You can't pry it or chop it or melt it.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,Not even when we leave.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,It's not the only thing. They're quite good at killing the better men.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,That's not the kind of queen I'm going to be.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,What is the House of the Undying?
Episode 5,jorah mormont,Do I know you?
Episode 5,jorah mormont,Who are you?
Episode 5,brienne,It looked like Stannis.
Episode 5,catelyn stark,To me it just looked like... A shadow in the shape of a man.
Episode 5,brienne,In the shape of Stannis.
Episode 5,catelyn stark,We should reach my son's camp tomorrow.
Episode 5,brienne,"Will you stay there long, my lady?"
Episode 5,catelyn stark,"Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen. After that, I will leave for Winterfell. My two youngest need me. I've been away from them for far too long."
Episode 5,brienne,I never knew my mother.
Episode 5,catelyn stark,I'm sorry.
Episode 5,catelyn stark,My own mother died on the birthing bed when I was very young.
Episode 5,brienne,It's a bloody business.
Episode 5,catelyn stark,What comes after is even harder.
Episode 5,brienne,"Once you're safely back amongst your own people, will you give me leave to go, my lady?"
Episode 5,catelyn stark,You mean to kill Stannis.
Episode 5,brienne,I swore a vow.
Episode 5,catelyn stark,But Stannis has a great army around him. His own guards are sworn to keep him safe.
Episode 5,catelyn stark,I'm as good as any of them. I should never have fled.
Episode 5,catelyn stark,Renly's death was no fault of yours. You served him bravely.
Episode 5,brienne,I only held him that once as he was dying.
Episode 5,catelyn stark,"He's gone, Brienne. You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth. Renly's enemies are Robb's enemies as well."
Episode 5,brienne,"I do not know your son, my lady. But I could serve you, if you would have me. You have courage. Not battle courage, perhaps, but, I don't know, a woman's kind of courage. And I think that when the time comes, you will not hold me back. Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis."
Episode 5,catelyn stark,"When the time comes, I will not hold you back."
Episode 5,brienne,"Then I am yours, my lady. I will shield your back and give my life for yours, if it comes to that. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new."
Episode 5,catelyn stark,I vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor. I swear it by the Old Gods and the new.
Episode 5,sam,I don't see very well.
Episode 5,jon snow,A fire.
Episode 5,jon snow,Where?
Episode 5,jon snow,"Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin."
Episode 5,jon snow,I've fought and killed a wight. How many rangers can say that?
Episode 5,sam,"I could take up Jon's duties while he's gone, my lord. It would be no trouble."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,He's not my manservant and he's not in love with me. He's my advisor and he's my friend.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,And what about what a woman wants?
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,Because I promised my khalasar I'd protect them and find them a safe home.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,I want them because they're mine by right. The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you?
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"So you wanted more than you had and you took it. You're a conqueror, too. You're just less ambitious."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"What do you want, Xaro Xhoan Daxos? At the gates of the city, you bled for me. Why?"
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,And behind the door?
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,And it can all be mine?
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,All I have to do?
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,That was a romantic proposal.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,If you cross the sea with an army you bought and a foreign husband who paid for it...
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another. Four false kings destroying the country.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,"To win Westeros, you need support from Westeros."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,The usurper is dead.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"The Starks fight the Lannisters, and Baratheons fight each other."
Episode 5,jorah mormont,According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand?
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,The time to strike is now. We need to find ships and an army or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,"Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get. They'll give you ships and soldiers and they'll own you forever. Moving carefully is the hard way, but it's the right way."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"And if I'd listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, we'd all be dead by now."
Episode 5,jorah mormont,"I know the opportunity before you seems like the last you'll ever have, but you musT-"
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,Do not speak to me like I'm a child.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,I only want-
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,What do you want? Tell me.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,To see you on the Iron Throne.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,Why?
Episode 5,jorah mormont,"You have a good claim. A title. A birthright. But you have something more than that. You may cover it up and deny it, but you have a gentle heart. You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved. Someone who can rule and should rule. Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world. There are times when I look at you and I still can't believe you're real."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"So what would you have me do, as my advisor?"
Episode 5,jorah mormont,"Make your own way. Find your own ship. You only need one. The allies we need are in Westeros, not Qarth."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,And how do I get the ship?
Episode 5,jorah mormont,I'll find it for you. A sound ship with a good captain.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,I look forward to meeting him.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,Khaleesi.
Episode 5,arya stark,You should stand sideface.
Episode 5,arya stark,Sideways.
Episode 5,arya stark,Smaller target.
Episode 5,arya stark,You're practicing for a fight. You should practice right.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,I've taken your castle.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,It's Prince Theon now. Get up. You have to get dressed. I've taken Winterfell. I took it. I'm occupying it. I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,To take the castle.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,And he sent me back to Pyke. I'm a Greyjoy. I can't fight for Robb and my father both. Where's Hodor?
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,Find the halfwit.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,My men are bringing your people together in the courtyard.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,So you and I can go down and tell them - how you've yielded Winterfell to me.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"Yes, you will."
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"The castle is mine. But these people are still yours. You'll yield to keep them safe, to keep them alive. That's what a good lord would do. Think carefully about what you want to say."
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,Louder. Say Prince Theon.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"Listen to your little lord, Farlen. He has more sense than you do."
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,My father has donned the ancient crown of Salt and Rock and declared himself King of the Iron Islands. He claims the North as well by right of conquest. You are all his subjects.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"If you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark, I will be as good to you as he ever was. Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't. Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here. And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister. Inform her that she's to bring You are a maester of the Citadel, sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell, are you not?"
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,I am the Lord of Winterfell as Bran just informed you. Send the ravens.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,I see you've finally learned how to address your betters. What do you want? I was brought here a captive.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,I'm the one who took you. What of it?
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"Serve me how? I need fighters, not kitchen sluts."
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,So you can bury it in my neck? Do you take me for a fool? Get up.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,You'll all go about your tasks as usual. And in a few days' time-
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes."
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,They are not my people.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"My brothers are dead. They died fighting Stark men, men like you."
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"Among them, but not one of them. I was his hostage, taken from my home."
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,He's not. He's dead. The Seven Kingdoms are at war. And Winterfell is mine.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"You've served this house faithfully, old man. But keep talking and I'll-"
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,Take him to the cells. Lock him up
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,I'll lock him in a cell until he rots.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"Ser Rodrik, I sentence you to death!"
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"He disrespected me in front of my men. That was his decision, not mine."
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,You'll address me as Prince Theon or you'll be next.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"You don't give commands anymore, little lord."
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"Any last words, old man?"
Episode 6,jon snow,"Ghost, stay with us. Ghost!"
Episode 6,jon snow,He's not a pet.
Episode 6,jon snow,Ghost is different.
Episode 6,jon snow,I thought you said you couldn't know wild things.
Episode 6,jon snow,We could do the same.
Episode 6,jon snow,My father always said I'm of the North.
Episode 6,jon snow,I wasn't joking.
Episode 6,jon snow,I'll gladly give my life.
Episode 6,jon snow,I do.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Can you read?
Episode 6,tywin lannister,This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand. It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"Girl, fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses. It's the one on this-"
Episode 6,tywin lannister,My cupbearer can read better than you.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance?
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"To the Starks of Winterfell! Who have twenty thousand men and my son! I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants. I see I overestimated you. If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll Leave us."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"Put the book away, girl. Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you're about it."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Mmm. Give us the room.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Clear all this.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,Lord Tywin.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Baelish.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Wine?
Episode 6,petyr baelish,Thank you.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,What news from the capital?
Episode 6,petyr baelish,I traveled here directly from Renly Baratheon's camp.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"Ah, the late King Renly. Rather a short reign. Murdered by a woman, I hear."
Episode 6,petyr baelish,So they say. There has been talk of other forces at work. Dark forces.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Here. Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it. Yes, a crisis is an opportunity. What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?"
Episode 6,petyr baelish,"After the Lannisters and the Starks, the Tyrells command the largest host. Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms, feeding horses and soldiers."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"Yes, yes, yes."
Episode 6,petyr baelish,The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings. Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly's death. And Margaery-
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Wants to be queen.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,"Yes, she does."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne. Against my grandson.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,"They did. And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,More wine for Lord Baelish.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,"If you will allow me to represent your family's interests, I believe that an advantageous agreement TYWIN"
Episode 6,petyr baelish,They have.
Episode 6,arya stark,"Pardon, my lord."
Episode 6,petyr baelish,It's only wine.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,You would ride there yourself?
Episode 6,petyr baelish,"Tonight, with your leave."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"I'll have an answer by nightfall. That'll be all, girl."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,And what else?
Episode 6,petyr baelish,"On your son Tyrion's directive, I met with Catelyn Stark."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Why?
Episode 6,petyr baelish,He had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Hmm.
Episode 6,jon snow,A girl.
Episode 6,jon snow,We could question her.
Episode 6,jon snow,What's your name?
Episode 6,jon snow,I'm Jon Snow.
Episode 6,jon snow,"No. No, I'll do it."
Episode 6,jon snow,I'm as much a crow as they are.
Episode 6,jon snow,Can't. Someone might see the smoke.
Episode 6,jon snow,I'll find them.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,"One day I pray you love someone. I pray you love her so much, when you close your eyes, you see her face. I want that for you. I want you to know what it's like to love someone, to truly love someone. Before I take her from you."
Episode 6,sansa stark,I saw you cry.
Episode 6,sansa stark,My little brother cried when I left Winterfell.
Episode 6,sansa stark,It seems a normal thing.
Episode 6,sansa stark,No.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Get the Prince back to the Keep now.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Move. Move!
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Where's Sansa?
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Oh, you blind, bloody fool!"
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"We've had vicious kings and we've had idiot kings, but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"I can, I am."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"They threw a cow pie at you, so you decided to kill them all? They're starving, you fool! All because of a war you started."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,And now I've struck a king. Did my hand fall from my wrist? Where is the Stark girl?
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"If she dies, you'll never get your Uncle Jaime back! You owe him quite a bit, you know."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Take some men and go and find the Stark girl.
Episode 6,sansa stark,Please! No! No!
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Are you hurt, my lady?"
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Well done, Clegane."
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,He shouldn't make me wait.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,I already have a husband.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you, my lord. You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want."
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,My birthright. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,I'm not asking you for the kingdoms. I'm asking you for ships.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,"My father sat there, before he was murdered."
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,I didn't come here to argue grammar.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,Not yet.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,There are many there that support my claim.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,I left when I was a baby.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,"Do you know lllyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, we've met."
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,"For my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs. He believed The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone. How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch. When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad. But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons."
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,Do you understand? I'm no ordinary woman. My dreams come true.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,"I am not your little princess. I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine. With fire and blood, I will take it."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Who taught you to read?
Episode 6,arya stark,"My father, my lord."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"Hmm. I taught my son Jaime to read. The maester came to me one day, told me he wasn't learning. He couldn't make sense of the letters. He reversed them in his head. The maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it. Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned. He hated me for it, for a time. For a long time. But he learned. Hmm. Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he?"
Episode 6,arya stark,A stonemason.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,A stonemason who could read? Hmm.
Episode 6,arya stark,He taught himself.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Quite a man. What killed him?
Episode 6,arya stark,Loyalty.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"You're a sharp little thing, aren't you?"
Episode 6,arya stark,"Did... Forgive me, my lord. I shouldn't ask questions."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,No. But you've already begun.
Episode 6,arya stark,"Did you know your father, my lord?"
Episode 6,tywin lannister,I did. I grew up with him. I watched him grow old.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"He loved us. He was a good man, but a weak man. A weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name. I'm cold."
Episode 6,arya stark,"I'll fetch more wood for the fire, my lord."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Mmm.
Episode 6,arya stark,"The armory, my lord."
Episode 6,arya stark,Lord Tywin sent me.
Episode 6,arya stark,Lord Tywin gave it to me.
Episode 6,arya stark,To take to the armory.
Episode 6,arya stark,Amory Lorch.
Episode 6,arya stark,Now!
Episode 6,arya stark,But he's going to tell Tywin. He's getting away. It has to be now.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Guard!
Episode 6,robb stark,Quent.
Episode 6,robb stark,Lady Talisa.
Episode 6,robb stark,"It's hard to keep all the rules straight. But if I remember my lessons, a woman of noble birth is always called a lady. Unless she's a queen or a princess. I could find someone who knows."
Episode 6,robb stark,Because it's obvious.
Episode 6,robb stark,I'd call you a liar.
Episode 6,robb stark,"Better at amputations, I'm afraid."
Episode 6,robb stark,Quite a pretty spot.
Episode 6,robb stark,I couldn't really discuss troop movements with you.
Episode 6,robb stark,"Of course, a spy would deny being a spy."
Episode 6,robb stark,"Perhaps you'd join me... If you've got time, of course, for, well-"
Episode 6,catelyn stark,Robb.
Episode 6,robb stark,"Mother. Mother, this is Lady Talisa. She's been helping with the wounded. She's been very... helpful."
Episode 6,catelyn stark,Lady Talisa.
Episode 6,catelyn stark,Lady Talisa...?
Episode 6,catelyn stark,"Maegyr? Forgive me, I do not know this name."
Episode 6,robb stark,I've missed you.
Episode 6,catelyn stark,"Yes, you look positively forlorn."
Episode 6,robb stark,"You surprised me, that's all. I didn't think I'd see you today."
Episode 6,catelyn stark,I wish that you were free to follow your heart.
Episode 6,robb stark,I know.
Episode 6,catelyn stark,You have inherited your father's responsibilities. I'm afraid they come at a cost. You are promised to another.
Episode 6,catelyn stark,A debt that must be paid.
Episode 6,robb stark,I haven't forgotten.
Episode 6,jon snow,We'll stop here. Too dark to go any farther today.
Episode 6,jon snow,There's no shelter anywhere.
Episode 6,jon snow,No fire.
Episode 6,jon snow,Yes.
Episode 6,jon snow,We start again at first light. Get some sleep.
Episode 6,jon snow,Stop moving.
Episode 6,jon snow,Stop it!
Episode 6,jon snow,You're still moving.
Episode 6,robb stark,This cannot be true.
Episode 6,robb stark,Why? Why would Theon-
Episode 6,robb stark,My brothers?
Episode 6,catelyn stark,"I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!"
Episode 6,robb stark,I must go north at once.
Episode 6,robb stark,How can I call myself king if I can't hold my own castle? How can I ask men to follow me if I can't-
Episode 6,catelyn stark,Let me go and talk to Theon.
Episode 6,robb stark,There will be no talk. He will die for this.
Episode 6,robb stark,"Tell your son Bran and Rickon's safety is paramount. And Theon, I want him brought to me alive. I want to look him in the eye and ask him why. And then I'll take his head myself."
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you?
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,How? And don't tell me to put a spear in your hand.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"I'm a prince now, and you'd do well-"
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,Like what?
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,You know things? Like what? How to eat dirt?
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,Wait outside.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,I always wondered what you had under there.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,I'm not killing you. That's your price.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"What do you want then, other than your miserable life?"
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"Well, you shall have it, then. But only if you serve me well."
Episode 6,sansa stark,Ow!
Episode 6,sansa stark,I thought they were going to kill me.
Episode 6,sansa stark,"He hated me, the man who hit me. I saw it in his eyes. Hated me. He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me."
Episode 6,sansa stark,Why? Why would a stranger-
Episode 6,sansa stark,I would have given them bread if I had it. I hate the king more than any of them.
Episode 6,sansa stark,But you're not the wrong people.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,The Spice King refuses me because I'm a bad investment. The Silk King won't support me because of his business with the Lannisters. Why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,Where are they? Where are my dragons?
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,"A cripple? You let a cripple escape? The boy can't walk, but somehow he slipped past you?"
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,"The giant? Hodor? Oh, that's all right, then. You let a halfwit escape with a cripple. And Rickon, too? The little one?"
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,Right. Get the horses and the hounds.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,Enjoying your first hunt?
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,"With hunting, there's blood at the end."
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,"I was a little boy when I was torn away from my home and brought here. So I kept my word. I never ran away. If I find them soon enough, I won't hurt them. Well, I'll hurt them, but I won't kill them."
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,They have no value to me missing.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,"Robb's in the Riverlands. My sister's in Deepwood Motte. She'll get here long before they do. And Ned Stark always said 500 men could hold Winterfell again 10,000."
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,"The hounds have the scent. Come, Maester, don't look so grim. It's all just a game."
Episode 7,jon snow,Let's move.
Episode 7,jon snow,I'm a man of the Night's Watch.
Episode 7,jon snow,Don't call them that.
Episode 7,jon snow,Neither. Both.
Episode 7,jon snow,Move!
Episode 7,jon snow,"There are no women of the Night's Watch, no."
Episode 7,jon snow,No.
Episode 7,jon snow,Never. We swore an oath.
Episode 7,jon snow,Would you please shut up?
Episode 7,jon snow,You're a free woman?
Episode 7,jon snow,"If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what ""prisoner"" means."
Episode 7,jon snow,It was my choice to say the words.
Episode 7,jon snow,Of course I like girls.
Episode 7,jon snow,That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.
Episode 7,jon snow,"Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!"
Episode 7,jon snow,"My father was Ned Stark. I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours."
Episode 7,tywin lannister,Wolfsbane. A rare substance. This is no common assassin.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,I don't care if you hanged a hundred. A man tried to kill me. I want his name and I want his head.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,"Pretentious name for a band of outlaws. We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity. We look like fools and they look like heroes. That's how kings fall. I want them dead, every one."
Episode 7,tywin lannister,"Burn the villages, burn the farms. Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side."
Episode 7,tywin lannister,Mmm. Is that mutton?
Episode 7,arya stark,"Yes, my lord."
Episode 7,tywin lannister,Don't like mutton.
Episode 7,arya stark,I'll bring something else.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,Leave it. Are you hungry?
Episode 7,arya stark,No.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,Of course you are. Eat.
Episode 7,arya stark,I'll eat in the kitchen later.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,It's bad manners to refuse a lordo s offer. Sit. Eat.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,You're small for your age. I suppose you've been underfed your whole life.
Episode 7,arya stark,I eat a lot. I just don't grow.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,Mmm. This will be my last war. Win or lose.
Episode 7,arya stark,Have you ever lost before?
Episode 7,tywin lannister,Do you think I'd be in my position if I had lost a war?
Episode 7,tywin lannister,"But this is the one I'll be remembered for. The War of the Five Kings, they're calling it. My legacy will be determined in the coming months."
Episode 7,tywin lannister,Do you know what legacy means? It's what you pass down to your children and your children's children. It's what remains of you when you're gone. Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy. The greatest fortress ever built.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,"The tallest towers, the strongest walls. The Great Hall had thirty-five hearths. Thirty-five. Can you imagine? Look at it now. A blasted ruin. Do you know what happened?"
Episode 7,arya stark,Dragons?
Episode 7,tywin lannister,Yes. Dragons happened.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,"Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land. A million men could have marched on these walls, and a million men would have been repelled. But an attack from the air with dragon fire, Mmm-mmm. Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls. Aegon Targaryen changed the rules. That's why every child alive still knows his name"
Episode 7,arya stark,Aegon and his sisters.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,Mmm?
Episode 7,arya stark,"It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon. It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too."
Episode 7,tywin lannister,"Correct. A student of history, are you?"
Episode 7,arya stark,Rhaenys rode Meraxes. Visenya rode Vhagar.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.
Episode 7,arya stark,Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior. She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,"Hmm. She's a heroine of yours, I take it?"
Episode 7,tywin lannister,Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?
Episode 7,arya stark,Most girls are idiots.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,You remind me of my daughter. Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?
Episode 7,arya stark,From my father.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,He was a well-read stonemason. Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.
Episode 7,arya stark,"Have you met many stonemasons, my lord?"
Episode 7,tywin lannister,"Careful now, girl. I enjoy you, but be careful. Take that back to the kitchen. Eat what you want."
Episode 7,tywin lannister,"And, girl."
Episode 7,tywin lannister,M'lord.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,"Lowborn girls say ""m'lord,"" not ""my lord. "" If you're going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly."
Episode 7,arya stark,"My mother served Lady Dustin for many years, my lord. She taught me how to speak proper Properly."
Episode 7,tywin lannister,You're too smart for your own good. Has anyone told you that?
Episode 7,arya stark,Yes.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,Go on.
Episode 7,sansa stark,"I beg pardon, ser. I should have come to you after to thank you for saving me. You were so brave."
Episode 7,sansa stark,Does it give you joy to scare people?
Episode 7,sansa stark,It was his duty. He never liked it.
Episode 7,sansa stark,Why are you always so hateful?
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,You are one of the Thirteen.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Nothing? They're more valuable than anything in the world.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"There is no we, so why would you help me get them back?"
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,But it did happen under your roof.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,I don't care where you've been.
Episode 7,jon snow,"No. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall."
Episode 7,jon snow,Walk.
Episode 7,jon snow,I know how to do it.
Episode 7,robb stark,And what did she say?
Episode 7,robb stark,And what then?
Episode 7,robb stark,"If every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative, Ser Alton, we'd all hang."
Episode 7,robb stark,"You've acted with honor. I thank you for it. Lord Karstark, see that Ser Alton's pen is clean, and give him a hot supper."
Episode 7,robb stark,Is there room for Ser Alton?
Episode 7,robb stark,Have the men build him a new pen. Put him in with the Kingslayer for now. Have your boy watch over them.
Episode 7,robb stark,That will be all.
Episode 7,robb stark,"And my enemies, as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning."
Episode 7,robb stark,That's what I tell my bannermen.
Episode 7,robb stark,But some are not.
Episode 7,robb stark,If you need help finding these-
Episode 7,robb stark,"Continue, my lady."
Episode 7,robb stark,Yes.
Episode 7,robb stark,I expect he will.
Episode 7,robb stark,Come with me to the Crag.
Episode 7,robb stark,"Let the maester show you his stores. I want the wounded men to be treated well, all the wounded men."
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,Try again.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,"I'm looking at spending the rest of my life being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people. Ask yourself, is there anything I wouldn't do to stop that from happening? The hounds will find the scent again. I'll beat them until they do. I'll whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand. And once I've got them, the pampered little shits It's better to be cruel than weak."
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,Where are they?
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,The Stark boys. Where are they?
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,Think harder.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,Go back to Winterfell. Take him back.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,You came back.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,As soon as I heard. Do you know anything?
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Irri is dead.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,I know. She was a good-
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,She's dead. She died alone. She died for me and I couldn't protect her.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,Doreah?
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"We can't find her. She must be dead, too. I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse."
Episode 7,jorah mormont,I should have been here.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,You went to find me a ship.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,My place is by your side. I shouldn't have left you alone with these people.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"These people""?"
Episode 7,jorah mormont,They are not to be trusted.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"And who is to be trusted? Who are my people? The Targaryens? I only knew one, my brother, and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown. The Dothraki? Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse."
Episode 7,jorah mormont,Your people are in Westeros.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,They will soon enough.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,And then what? They'll pray for my return? They'll wave dragon banners and shout my name? That's what my brother believed and he was a fool.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,"You are not your brother. Trust me, Khaleesi."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"There it is. ""Trust me. "" And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you? I don't need trust any longer. I don't want it and I don't have room for it."
Episode 7,jorah mormont,You are too young to be so-
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,And you are too familiar.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,"Forgive me, Khaleesi. No one can survive in this world without help. No one. Let me help you, please. Tell me how."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Find my dragons.
Episode 7,jon snow,We're close.
Episode 7,jon snow,Nothing happened between you and me.
Episode 7,jon snow,Turn back around.
Episode 7,jon snow,"What, right here in the muck?"
Episode 7,jon snow,That's enough.
Episode 7,jon snow,Enough!
Episode 7,sansa stark,"No, no!"
Episode 7,sansa stark,"No. Oh, no."
Episode 7,sansa stark,"If the Queen sees, I can have Joffrey's children now."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"Your mother might have prepared you. You flowered, my dear. No more."
Episode 7,sansa stark,"My mother told me, but I thought it would be different."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,In what way?
Episode 7,sansa stark,I thought it would be less messy.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Wait until you birth a child.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,You're a woman now. Do you have any idea what that means?
Episode 7,sansa stark,I'm fit to bear children for the king?
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"A prospect that once delighted you, bringing little princes and princesses into the world, the greatest honor for a queen."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"Joffrey has always been difficult. Even his birth, I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world. You cannot imagine the pain. I screamed so loudly, I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood."
Episode 7,sansa stark,His Grace was not with you?
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"Robert was hunting. That was his custom. Whenever my time was near, my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds. And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head, and I would present him with a baby. Not that I wanted him there, mind you. I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother. When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out. Joffrey will show you no such devotion."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"You may never love the king, but you will love his children."
Episode 7,sansa stark,I love His Grace with all my heart.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"That's so very touching to hear. Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. The more people you love, the weaker you are. You'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do. You'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe. Love no one but your children. On that front, a mother has no choice."
Episode 7,sansa stark,"But shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace?"
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"You can try, little dove."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Who did you say your mother was again?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Is she the fat one?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"No, no. There's only one fat Lannister. If she was your mother, you'd know it."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,When?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,I went to Willem Frey's wedding?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,He threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds. What was his name?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"Poor lad. That was my brother's doing, I seem to recall. I remember you. You'd never squired for anyone before."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"You didn't, though."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"You knew when you were needed and when to go away. It's a rare talent. Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,You were saying?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,I understand completely.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"It's just that I, I was sixteen once. I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Barristan Selmy. The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws. Before your time.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"He was a painter. A painter who only used red. I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then. And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect. I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"It's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"No. I didn't have your gift. He couldn't take a step without stepping on me. I was awful, a complete liability. Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a sixteen-year-old squire."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"It's a good thing I am who I am. I'd have been useless at anything else. I'm not well-suited for imprisonment. Shocking, I know. Some men are. Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end. Not me, though. My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Of course. Every day.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"Good prisoners breed good jailers, apparently. The Starks are very careful."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"But there is a way, I think. It wasn't possible until now."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,It's actually quite simple.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,You'll only have to do one thing.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,You'll have to die.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,I didn't come here for lessons.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,You have them? Where are they?
Episode 7,jorah mormont,Where are the dragons?
Episode 7,jorah mormont,Never.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"Please, they're my children. I'm begging you."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"Without me, the dragons will die."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,How?
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,You have my dragons?
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,But there is no King of Qarth.
Episode 7,brienne,No farther.
Episode 7,brienne,"Don't enter without an invitation, man."
Episode 7,catelyn stark,What is it?
Episode 7,catelyn stark,"Lord Karstark, this man is our prisoner."
Episode 7,catelyn stark,"And crippled mine. He will answer for his crimes, I promise you, but not here."
Episode 7,catelyn stark,"You will strike me down? Have you forgotten me, ser? I am the widow of your liege, Lord Eddard Stark. I am the mother of your king!"
Episode 7,robb stark,You know very well.
Episode 7,catelyn stark,How dare you!
Episode 7,brienne,Threatening my lady is an act of treason.
Episode 7,catelyn stark,"I understand your grief, my lord, better than most, I understand it. But in the name of my son, the King in the North, stand down."
Episode 7,catelyn stark,Wise men do not make demands of kings.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"Thank you for fighting on my behalf, Lady Stark. I would have come to your defense, but-"
Episode 7,catelyn stark,Take him to the stockades. Bind him with every chain you can find!
Episode 7,jaime lannister,You've become a real she-wolf in your later years. There's not much fish left in you.
Episode 7,catelyn stark,And gag him!
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,Since when do you light your own candles?
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Since I decided that I can't stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,How many times can you read one raven scroll?
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"Stannis Baratheon's fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth, two hundred ships."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,More than we have.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"Yes, that's more than we have. He'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"We have strong, high walls. We'll rain fire down on them from above."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"Rain fire on them from above."" You're quoting Father, aren't you?"
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?"
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"Call it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it. The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here. It's just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,He needs to start acting like a king. This war you started is coming to our doorstep. And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead
Episode 7,cersei lannister,I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,I thought the girls might help him.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Did you?
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,I was wrong. If we can't control him
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Do you think I haven't tried? He doesn't listen to me.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,I always hoped he'd be like Jaime. He looks like him. In a certain light.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,The boy is more Robert than Jaime.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty. Sometimes I wonder. What? If this is the price for what we've done, for our sins."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,Sins?
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"The Targaryens wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? ""Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin."""
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"You've beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them."
Episode 7,brienne,"Your son returns at dawn, my lady?"
Episode 7,catelyn stark,So they say.
Episode 7,brienne,"The Kingslayer won't last the night. The more they drink, the angrier they'll get. And when the Karstarks draw their swords Who wants to die defending a Lannister?"
Episode 7,catelyn stark,Come.
Episode 7,catelyn stark,I need to be alone with him.
Episode 7,catelyn stark,"Your orders, which I just gave you, are to leave me alone with him."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"Come to say goodbye, Lady Stark? I believe it's my last night in this world. Is that a woman?"
Episode 7,catelyn stark,Do you hear them out there? They want your head.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.
Episode 7,catelyn stark,You strangled his son with your chains.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Oh. Oh. Was he the one on guard duty? He was in my way. Any knight would have done the same.
Episode 7,catelyn stark,You are no knight. You have forsaken every vow you ever took.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"So many vows. They make you swear and swear. Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak. But what if your father despises the king? What if the king massacres the innocent? It's too much. No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another. Where did you find this beast?"
Episode 7,catelyn stark,"She is a truer knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"Kingslayer. What a king he was. Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back."
Episode 7,catelyn stark,You are a man without honor.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"Do you know, I've never been with any woman but Cersei. So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned. What was the name of that bastard he fathered?"
Episode 7,catelyn stark,Brienne.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"No, that wasn't it. Snow, a bastard from the North. Now, when When good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it? No. You're not very good at pretending. You're an honest woman. You hated that boy, didn't you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman."
Episode 7,catelyn stark,Your sword.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,I told you what would happen. All of you. I told you what would happen if you served me loyally. And what would happen if you did not.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,"If there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says, here is the answer to your question."
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,Envy isn't attractive.
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,You should be proud of your brother's achievement. I took the great castle of Winterfell with twenty men.
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,"I treated the Stark boys with honor, and they repaid me with treachery."
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,Before I had to kill them- I treated them-
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,Exactly.
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,They made me a promise
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,Don't call me
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,"If I hadn't killed them, the Northerners would think me weak."
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,I'm warning you.
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,You haven't brought enough men. How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot?
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,Is this a joke? Winterfell is the heart of the North.
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,He won't find out. We've killed all the ravens. We have all the horses. I've taken Winterfell. And I will keep Winterfell.
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,I don't intend to die.
Episode 8,jon snow,"I couldn't do it. I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't-"
Episode 8,jon snow,The others?
Episode 8,jon snow,They died because of me.
Episode 8,robb stark,I've never met her.
Episode 8,robb stark,"Frey, I suppose. I don't know her first name."
Episode 8,robb stark,An important bridge.
Episode 8,robb stark,"It was before they killed my father. I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time, but only if I crossed that bridge."
Episode 8,robb stark,"He was the best man I ever met. I know children always think that about their fathers, but"
Episode 8,robb stark,"He once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them. The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect. The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect. The soldiers you order into battle. He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night. I didn't believe him. I asked him, ""How can a man be brave if he's afraid?"" ""That is the only time a man can be brave,"" he told me."
Episode 8,robb stark,He would have liked you.
Episode 8,robb stark,He didn't care much about gold or glory.
Episode 8,robb stark,Because we'll never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated. And because I believe in justice.
Episode 8,robb stark,That would be a start.
Episode 8,robb stark,How? How?
Episode 8,robb stark,Tell me this isn't true.
Episode 8,robb stark,Why?
Episode 8,catelyn stark,For the girls.
Episode 8,robb stark,You betrayed me.
Episode 8,catelyn stark,Robb-
Episode 8,robb stark,No! You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway.
Episode 8,catelyn stark,"Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell. Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing. I have five children, and only one of them is free."
Episode 8,catelyn stark,"I grieve for your sons, my lord."
Episode 8,catelyn stark,"Killing Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children, but returning him to King's Landing may buy life for mine."
Episode 8,robb stark,Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool. You've weakened our position. You've brought discord into our camp. And you did it all behind my back. Make sure she's guarded day and night.
Episode 8,catelyn stark,Robb. How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer?
Episode 8,robb stark,Send another forty with our fastest horses.
Episode 8,catelyn stark,Robb.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,Damn.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,"You're much uglier in daylight. What's your name? I'm Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin."
Episode 8,jaime lannister,A captive knight has a right to know his captor's identity.
Episode 8,brienne,Brienne of Tarth.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,"Tarth, Tarth, Tarth. Crescent moons and starbursts. Lord Selwyn Tarth. Your father. Do you have any brothers and sisters, my lady? It's a long way to King's Landing. Might as well get to know one another."
Episode 8,jaime lannister,Have you known many men? I suppose not. Women? Horses? Ah.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,"I didn't mean to give offense, my lady. Forgive me."
Episode 8,brienne,"Your crimes are past forgiveness, Kingslayer."
Episode 8,jaime lannister,Why do you hate me so much? Have I ever harmed you?
Episode 8,brienne,"You've harmed others, those you were sworn to protect, the weak, the innocent."
Episode 8,jaime lannister,Has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly?
Episode 8,brienne,You will not provoke me to anger.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,I already have. Look at you. You're ready to chop my head off. Do you think you could? Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight?
Episode 8,brienne,I've never seen you fight.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,The answer is no. There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me. You're not one of them.
Episode 8,brienne,All my life men like you have sneered at me. And all my life I've been knocking men like you into the dust.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,"If you're so confident, unlock my chains. Let's see what happens."
Episode 8,brienne,Do you take me for an idiot? In!
Episode 8,jaime lannister,"I took you for a fighter, a man Pardon. Woman of honor. Was I wrong? You're afraid."
Episode 8,brienne,"Maybe one day we'll find out, Kingslayer."
Episode 8,tywin lannister,Surrender the Iron Throne?
Episode 8,tywin lannister,"No, a king who runs will not be king for long. He's a Lannister. He'll stand and fight. Stannis, two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep."
Episode 8,tywin lannister,"Ha! The last time the scouts assured us of Stark's movement, he lured us into a trap. Which is why my son is his prisoner."
Episode 8,tywin lannister,Too close to Casterly Rock.
Episode 8,tywin lannister,He's a boy and he's never lost a battle. He'll risk anything at any time because he doesn't know enough to be afraid.
Episode 8,tywin lannister,"We'll ride at nightfall. I want a full night's march before he knows we're on the move. Clegane, you'll maintain a garrison here at Harrenhal. Track down this brotherhood and destroy them. The girl has proven herself a good servant. She'll stay on with you. See that he doesn't get drunk in the evenings. He's poor company when he's sober, but he's better at his work."
Episode 8,arya stark,Where's Jaqen?
Episode 8,arya stark,I need him now. Lord Tywin's marching tonight.
Episode 8,arya stark,He's helping me.
Episode 8,arya stark,Where?
Episode 8,jon snow,They'll never trust me.
Episode 8,jon snow,What?
Episode 8,jon snow,I didn't.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Do you have to do that here?
Episode 8,bronn,I like to keep me hands clean.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Yes, but do you have to do it here?"
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,You should start wearing the gold cloak.
Episode 8,bronn,I don't want to wear a gold cloak.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,You're commander of the City Watch. You shouldn't be dressed like a common
Episode 8,bronn,"A cloak slows you down in a fight. Makes it hard to move quietly. And the gold catches the light, so you're nice and easy to spot at night."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer. You're supposed to stand out."
Episode 8,bronn,We had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Fine, fine. No gold cloak."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,What?
Episode 8,bronn,What?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,What? What? Why are you staring at me?
Episode 8,bronn,You don't want me cleaning me nails. You don't want me looking your way. Why am I here?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,To help me plan the defense of King's Landing.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Stannis will be here any day.
Episode 8,bronn,And one of these explains how to beat him?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros. "" By Archmaester Shevelathin. Shevelatesh."
Episode 8,bronn,Chevalteesh. I'd swap all your books for a few good archers.
Episode 8,varys,My Lord Hand. Commander. I must compliment you on the gold cloaks' performance these last few weeks. Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,I did not know. And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?
Episode 8,bronn,Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,For questioning?
Episode 8,bronn,No. It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,We talked about this.
Episode 8,bronn,"Aye, we talked about it. Have you ever been in a city under siege? Maybe this part's not in your books. See, it's not the fighting that kills most people. It's the starving. Foodo s worth more than gold. Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes. Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other."
Episode 8,bronn,"The thieves, they love a siege. Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food. By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town."
Episode 8,varys,"Given the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted."
Episode 8,varys,"Ah. ""The Great Sieges of Westeros."" Thrilling subject. Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan wasn't a better writer."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Stannis knows King's Landing. He knows where the walls are strongest, and he knows which gates are weakest. The Mud Gate. A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and it's only 50 yards from the water. That's where he'll land."
Episode 8,varys,"And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan?"
Episode 8,bronn,We could throw books at his men.
Episode 8,varys,We don't have that many books.
Episode 8,bronn,"We don't have that many men, either."
Episode 8,varys,What do we have?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Pig shit.
Episode 8,sam,I'm not cut out for this sort of work.
Episode 8,sam,Where do you think Jon is right now?
Episode 8,sam,"He's not dead. No, Jon's a great fighter."
Episode 8,sam,He's got a Valyrian steel sword.
Episode 8,sam,And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.
Episode 8,sam,The First Men made these marks. Help me with it.
Episode 8,sam,That's a Night's Watch cloak.
Episode 8,sam,Oh. Must be dragonglass.
Episode 8,sam,The maesters call it obsidian.
Episode 8,arya stark,I'm sorry. I'll-
Episode 8,arya stark,Where were you?
Episode 8,arya stark,"Tywin Lannister was right here, and now he's gone."
Episode 8,arya stark,How long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone?
Episode 8,arya stark,He's taking his army to attack my brother. I need him dead right now.
Episode 8,arya stark,You promised you'd help me.
Episode 8,arya stark,And you'll kill them? Anybody?
Episode 8,arya stark,All right. Jaqen H'ghar.
Episode 8,arya stark,That's right.
Episode 8,arya stark,I'm not joking. A man can go kill himself.
Episode 8,arya stark,No.
Episode 8,arya stark,I'll un-name you.
Episode 8,arya stark,If you help me and my friends escape.
Episode 8,arya stark,"Fine, Jaqen H'ghar."
Episode 8,arya stark,A girl will obey.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Thank you, Podrick."
Episode 8,cersei lannister,Odd little boy.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,You and Varys both.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Excellent lamprey pie. Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting. An inspiration for the troops. The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,He's only a boy.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Younger boys are off fighting his war.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,He's not ready.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"What is he, seventeen? Remember Jaime at seventeen?"
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"Better than you. Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't. His place is not on the battlefield."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"It's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us."
Episode 8,cersei lannister,Do you think I'm an idiot?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"No, I'd say you possess above-average intelligence."
Episode 8,cersei lannister,You shipped off my only daughter. And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Any dessert?
Episode 8,cersei lannister,Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Because he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,Because he doesn't have a cock.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Neither do you.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"Perhaps I'm dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,It's not that little.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Why are you smiling?
Episode 8,cersei lannister,Because I'm happy.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,And why are you happy?
Episode 8,cersei lannister,Because I have your little whore.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,I thought you preferred blondes.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"Such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good. Father will be so pleased."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Why do you care who I fuck?
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"Because a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,This is madness. Stannis will be here in days. You need me.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore. Lovely body. The bruises will heal in time."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Where did you find her?
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,You've forgotten the most important thing about whores.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"Oh? Well, you're the expert. Tell me."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"You don't buy them, you only rent them."
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"You're usually a better liar, baby brother. This one you like. You like her very much. Could it be love? Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough. Unless Joffrey is hurt. And then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer, too. And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,And how do I know you haven't killed her already?
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"Would you like to see her? I thought you might. Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,I'm sorry they hurt you. You must be brave.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,I promise I will free you.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Never.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you're safe and happy, and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid."
Episode 8,cersei lannister,Get out.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Shae!
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,You're beautiful.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,We have to be more careful.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,There are people who want to hurt me.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,I would kill for you. Do you know that? I expect I'll have to before this is over. You're mine.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Promise me.
Episode 8,robb stark,Still no word?
Episode 8,robb stark,Theon has my brothers. If we storm the castle
Episode 8,robb stark,Send word to your son. Any Ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes.
Episode 8,robb stark,Any Ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy. He betrayed our cause. He betrayed me. And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs.
Episode 8,robb stark,How am I? I've had to arrest my mother. The Lannisters have my sisters. The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers. I'm fighting a war and I don't know if I should march south or north.
Episode 8,robb stark,No. Forgive me. You're being kind. I have no right.
Episode 8,robb stark,That's not the kind of king I want to be.
Episode 8,robb stark,I don't know. The good kind. Most kings grew up as princes. They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown. I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.
Episode 8,robb stark,I'd like to hear you play the harp.
Episode 8,robb stark,How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men's feet?
Episode 8,robb stark,I don't want to marry the Frey girl.
Episode 8,arya stark,Shut up. What did you bring?
Episode 8,arya stark,"He didn't say. He just said, ""Walk through the gates."""
Episode 8,arya stark,He didn't say anything about the guards.
Episode 8,arya stark,We have to trust him.
Episode 8,arya stark,Shut up. Stay here if you're afraid.
Episode 8,davos,"If the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day."
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,Will it hold?
Episode 8,davos,"Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace."
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,"I admire you, Ser Davos."
Episode 8,davos,"I thank you, Your Grace."
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,"Pleased to hear it. Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you. So you take the onion for your sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag."
Episode 8,davos,"My son wishes me to change it. Three mermen with tridents, something like that. I understand why the older families look down at me."
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,Do you? Why?
Episode 8,davos,My father was a crabber.
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,And?
Episode 8,davos,"Well, sons of lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers. Our hands stink."
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,And where were those lords when Storm's End starved?
Episode 8,davos,Many fought bravely for your brother. Many fought for the Mad King.
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,You defend these men who insult you behind your back.
Episode 8,davos,Some are happy to do it to my face.
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,"We were forgotten. Robert and Ned Stark, they were the heroes. The glorious rebels marching from battle to battle, liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King, while I held Storm's End with five hundred men."
Episode 8,davos,"No one has forgotten, Your Grace."
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,No? Robert did. He gave Storm's End to Renly after the war. Renly never fought a day in his life.
Episode 8,davos,He was only a boy.
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,Then why'd he give him Storm's End?
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,"First, we ate the horses. We weren't riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine. I do like dogs. Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them. Then the rats. The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying. She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail. And then you made it through the lines. Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions."
Episode 8,davos,"And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe."
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.
Episode 8,davos,I was relieved they did not.
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,"Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it. Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up. Insult or no, I gave it up. Because Robert was my older brother, and he was the king and I've always done my duty. But now, I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros. And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand."
Episode 8,davos,"Your Grace, I pray I serve you well."
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge.
Episode 8,varys,"No man can be in all rooms at all times. I have many little birds in the North, my lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?"
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"A brave choice, Your Grace. I'm sure your men will line up behind you."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Imagine Stannis' terror.
Episode 8,varys,I am trying.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,You're an intelligent man. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.
Episode 8,varys,"Oh, no one disputes that, my lord, not even the multitudes who despise you."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men."
Episode 8,varys,"I wish we could, too."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,What do you want? Tell me.
Episode 8,varys,"If we're going to play, you'll have to start."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history. My sister became queen at the age of nineteen. When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock."
Episode 8,varys,A most highborn plumber.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,The water never flowed better. And all the shit found its way to the sea. I never expected to have any real power. So when my father named me acting Hand
Episode 8,varys,"You're quite good at being Hand, you know? Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men. Honorable men. But they disdained the game and those who played. You enjoy the game."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,I do. Last thing I expected.
Episode 8,varys,And you play it well.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"I'd like to keep playing it. If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over."
Episode 8,varys,They say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?"
Episode 8,varys,"In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with sixteen teats."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,We should sail there immediately.
Episode 8,varys,"This morning, I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste. Daenerys Targaryen lives."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.
Episode 8,varys,"She has three dragons. But even if what they say is true, it'll be years before they are fully grown. And then there will be nowhere to hide."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"One game at a time, my friend."
Episode 8,jorah mormont,"Careful, Khaleesi. Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have a thousand eyes watching for you. I found one. A ship with a good captain. She leaves for Astapor tomorrow."
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Astapor?
Episode 8,jorah mormont,We cannot stay here.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,They have my dragons. A mother does not flee without her children.
Episode 8,jorah mormont,"They're not your children. I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them, but you didn't grow them in your womb. They didn't suckle at your breast. They are dragons, Khaleesi. And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die."
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,You should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there.
Episode 8,jorah mormont,"You know I would die for you. I will never abandon you. I'm sworn to protect you, to serve."
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,"Then serve me. If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there."
Episode 8,jorah mormont,"That's what the warlock wants. He told you so himself. If you enter that place, you will never leave again. His magic is strong."
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,And what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire. You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me? Do you remember?
Episode 8,jorah mormont,"Until my last breath, I will remember. After I have forgotten my mother's face."
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,They are my children. And they are the only children I will ever have. Take me to them.
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,We should bury them.
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,"If they haven't got the damn message yet, a few more days won't help. As you say. But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer."
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,Gold for the farmer. For his trouble.
Episode 9,davos,"Aye, but we have the wind. She'll blow us straight to the gates."
Episode 9,davos,King's Landing hasn't been home for twenty years. I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet. And now I'm sailing right at them.
Episode 9,davos,"Of course, there are several royal fleets at the moment."
Episode 9,davos,Gods be good.
Episode 9,davos,But not over them?
Episode 9,davos,"Well, first, we have to put it there."
Episode 9,davos,"Our army outnumber theirs five-to-one. Those walls have never been breached, and the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they don't see a liberator, they see a stranger come to set their city on fire."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. But it's not your war.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,You can't fuck your way out of everything.
Episode 9,cersei lannister,Your words are always wise and measured.
Episode 9,cersei lannister,You brought me something?
Episode 9,cersei lannister,I know what ten drops will bring.
Episode 9,cersei lannister,You may not. You must have a lot of work to do. I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"Be careful on the stairs, Grand Maester. There are so many."
Episode 9,bronn,To the boys!
Episode 9,bronn,Drunk Lannisters.
Episode 9,bronn,Thank you very much.
Episode 9,bronn,"Well, now let's see. First time, I was five. My mam smacked me with an iron poker."
Episode 9,bronn,It wasn't me she was aiming at. She was trying for my little brother. Now he was a real pest.
Episode 9,bronn,"Second time, I was nine. Got in a scrap with a few older boys. They won. Third time-"
Episode 9,bronn,"Eh, you don't want to know about the third time."
Episode 9,bronn,Don't feel sorry for him. He'll be halfway up your arse before the night's through.
Episode 9,bronn,"Welcome, friends. This roundo s on me."
Episode 9,bronn,I don't think he likes me.
Episode 9,bronn,I know it.
Episode 9,bronn,It's warm in here. We've got beautiful women and good brown ale. Plenty for everyone. And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company.
Episode 9,bronn,And quicker. Eh?
Episode 9,bronn,Aye I expect he will someday.
Episode 9,bronn,One more drink before the war? Shall we?
Episode 9,varys,"I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror. A dead king, a city under siege."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,A wedding.
Episode 9,varys,"Exactly. Podrick, is that it?"
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Is that it?"" Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town."
Episode 9,varys,I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting.
Episode 9,varys,Do you trust him?
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Oddly enough, I do."
Episode 9,varys,Good.
Episode 9,varys,The map you asked for.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,There must be twenty miles of tunnels beneath the city.
Episode 9,varys,Closer to fifty. The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her."
Episode 9,varys,"That is good to hear. Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat. You look well suited for battle, my lord."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Well, I'm not."
Episode 9,varys,"For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong. My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from Asshai."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,What of it?
Episode 9,varys,"You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?"
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think?"
Episode 9,varys,I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Mmm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself."
Episode 9,varys,"And yet I have seen things and heard things, things you have not, things I wish I had not. I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"No, I don't believe you have."
Episode 9,varys,"One day, I will. The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse. And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him."
Episode 9,davos,I've never known bells to mean surrender. They want to play music with us? Let's play. Drums.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Remember, wait till the ships-"
Episode 9,bronn,The ships are in the bay.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,They must be far enough in-
Episode 9,bronn,"I know what ""in"" means. Do you know how to use that?"
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"I chopped wood once. No, I watched my brother chopping wood."
Episode 9,bronn,I saw you kill a man with a shield. You'll be unstoppable with an ax.
Episode 9,bronn,Don't get killed.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Nor you, my friend."
Episode 9,bronn,"Oh, are we friends now?"
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Of course we are. Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.
Episode 9,bronn,"Enhances it, really."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Oh! ""Enhances."" Fancy word for a sellsword."
Episode 9,bronn,Been spending time with fancy folks.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Lady Sansa and Sheila.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Shae, yes. Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegor's holdfast."
Episode 9,sansa stark,"She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Always been a great romantic, my nephew."
Episode 9,sansa stark,"I will pray for your safe return, my lord."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Will you?
Episode 9,sansa stark,Just as I pray for the king's.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Stay safe, my lady."
Episode 9,sansa stark,Will you slay him yourself?
Episode 9,sansa stark,So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard?
Episode 9,sansa stark,"I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid. Of course you'll be in the vanguard. They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest. And he is only a pretender."
Episode 9,sansa stark,Joffrey will. The worst ones always live.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,On the way.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"That would make me the quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet."
Episode 9,davos,Where are their ships?
Episode 9,davos,Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago. There are no surprises here.
Episode 9,davos,Maybe.
Episode 9,sansa stark,I don't know why she wants me here. She's always saying how stupid I am. She hates me.
Episode 9,sansa stark,I doubt it.
Episode 9,sansa stark,Why would she be jealous?
Episode 9,cersei lannister,Sansa.
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"I was wondering where our little dove had flown. You look pale, child. Is your red flower still blooming?"
Episode 9,sansa stark,Yes.
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"Fitting, isn't it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here. Pour Lady Sansa some wine."
Episode 9,cersei lannister,So? I didn't offer you water.
Episode 9,sansa stark,What's he doing here?
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"Ser llyn? He's here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him."
Episode 9,sansa stark,But we have guards to defend us.
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"Guards we have paid. Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors."
Episode 9,cersei lannister,The battle's first traitors. Have Ser llyn see to them. Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.
Episode 9,cersei lannister,The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy. Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen.
Episode 9,sansa stark,You said he was here to protect us.
Episode 9,cersei lannister,He is. Traitors are a danger to us all. More wine.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Archers to their marks.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Hold fast.
Episode 9,davos,"Archers, stand to! Man the below! Nock."
Episode 9,davos,Draw! Hold.
Episode 9,davos,There's no one on board.
Episode 9,davos,Wildfire. Steer clear! Steer clear!
Episode 9,davos,Matthos! Get down!
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,Prepare to land.
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,The dwarf has played his little trick.
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,He can only play it once.
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,Thousands.
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,Come with me and take this city!
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"Sansa, come here, little dove."
Episode 9,sansa stark,My queen.
Episode 9,cersei lannister,What are you doing?
Episode 9,sansa stark,Praying.
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"You're perfect, aren't you? Praying. What are you praying for?"
Episode 9,sansa stark,For the gods to have mercy on us all.
Episode 9,cersei lannister,Oh. On all of us?
Episode 9,sansa stark,"Yes, Your Grace."
Episode 9,cersei lannister,Even me?
Episode 9,sansa stark,"Of course, Your Grace."
Episode 9,cersei lannister,Even Joffrey?
Episode 9,sansa stark,Joffrey is my-
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"Oh, shut up, you little fool. Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all. The gods have no mercy. That's why they're gods. My father told me that when he caught me praying. My mother had just died, you see. I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it. I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the gods would return my mother to me. I was four."
Episode 9,sansa stark,Your father doesn't believe in the gods?
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"He believes in them, he just doesn't like them very much."
Episode 9,cersei lannister,One for her.
Episode 9,cersei lannister,Here. Sit. Drink.
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"Not like that. Drink, girl."
Episode 9,cersei lannister,I should have been born a man. I'd rather face a thousand swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens.
Episode 9,sansa stark,They are your guests under your protection. You asked them here.
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"It was expected of me, as it will be of you if you ever become Joffrey's queen. If my wretched brother should somehow prevail, these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them, lifted their spirits."
Episode 9,sansa stark,And if the city should fall?
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"You'd like that, wouldn't you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person. If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon. I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse."
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"Have I shocked you, little dove? Tears aren't a woman's only weapon. The best one's between your legs. Learn how to use it. Drink."
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked? No, you wouldn't, would you? If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape. Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning. You'll be glad of your red flower then. When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good. A precious thing like you will look very, very good. A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"He's a serious man, Stannis Baratheon."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Rain fire on them.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground. Pod, run to the King's Gate. Bring any men guarding it here, now."
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,"To the Mud Gate, go now!"
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"When we were young, Jaime and I, we looked so much alike even our father couldn't tell us apart. I could never understand why they treated us differently. Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace, and I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to Casterly Rock, and I was sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired."
Episode 9,sansa stark,You were Robert's queen.
Episode 9,cersei lannister,And you will be Joffrey's. Enjoy. I don't think I know this one.
Episode 9,cersei lannister,Pretty.
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"That's the worst curtsy I've ever seen. Here, it's not difficult. I mastered it when I was four. Straighten your back and bend."
Episode 9,cersei lannister,Better. You learn fast. How long have you been in Lady Sansa's service?
Episode 9,cersei lannister,When did you leave Lorath?
Episode 9,cersei lannister,I had a Lorathi handmaiden once.
Episode 9,cersei lannister,But she was a nobleman's daughter. You're not. When did you come to Westeros?
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"From Lorathi commoner to the Red Keep in ten years, all without learning how to curtsy. I imagine that's a very interesting story. What's your name?"
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"Tell us a story, Shae."
Episode 9,cersei lannister,What news?
Episode 9,cersei lannister,Where is Joffrey?
Episode 9,cersei lannister,Bring him back inside at once.
Episode 9,cersei lannister,What?
Episode 9,cersei lannister,Bring him back to his chambers now.
Episode 9,cersei lannister,With the women and children? Do you want him to be mocked as a coward for the rest of his life?
Episode 9,cersei lannister,Now!
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"When I told you about Ser llyn earlier, I lied. Do you want to hear the truth? You want to know why he's really here? He's here for us. Stannis may take the city, he may take the throne, but he will not take us alive."
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,Get the ladders up!
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Can I get you some iced milk and a nice bowl of raspberries, too?"
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,You're on the wrong side of the wall.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"You're Kingsguard, Clegane. You must beat them back or they're going to take this city. Your king's city."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"If you won't defend your own city, why should they?"
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Lead. Get down there and lead your people against the invaders who want to kill them.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,I'll lead the attack. I'll lead the attack!
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Pod, my helmet. Ser Mandon, you will bear the king's banner. Men, form up. Men Men! They say I'm half a man. But what does that make the lot of you?"
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,There's another way out. I'm going to show you. We'll come out behind them and fuck them in their arses.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Don't fight for your king and don't fight for his kingdoms. Don't fight for honor. Don't fight for glory. Don't fight for riches, because you won't get any. This is your city Stannis means to sack. That's your gate he's ramming. If he gets in, it will be your houses he burns, your gold he steals, your women he will rape."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them.
Episode 9,cersei lannister,Where is my son?
Episode 9,cersei lannister,Why do I care what you want? Bring me-
Episode 9,sansa stark,"Don't be afraid. The queen has raised the drawbridge. This is the safest place we can be. Joffrey's not hurt. He's fighting bravely. His knights have rallied behind him. They will save the city. Shall we sing a hymn? Gentle mother, fount of mercy..."
Episode 9,sansa stark,Come with me.
Episode 9,sansa stark,The queen said they'd rape everyone.
Episode 9,sansa stark,What are you doing here?
Episode 9,sansa stark,Where?
Episode 9,sansa stark,What about the king?
Episode 9,sansa stark,I'll be safe here. Stannis won't hurt me.
Episode 9,sansa stark,You won't hurt me.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Attack!
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Oh, fuck me."
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"Shh! Be calm, my sweet."
Episode 9,cersei lannister,No one's going to hurt you. I'll tell you a story. You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub? They lived in the woods.
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"Yes, my love. In the Kingswood, there lived a mother and her cub. She loved him very much. But there were other things that lived in the woods. Evil things."
Episode 9,cersei lannister,Like stags.
Episode 9,cersei lannister,And wolves.
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"He could hear them howling in the night. The little cub was frightened. His mother said, ""You are a lion, my son. You mustn't be afraid."""
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"For one day, all the beasts will bow to you. You will be king. All the stags will bow. All the wolves will bow. The bears in the north and the foxes of the south, all the birds in the sky and the beasts in the sea, they will all come to you, little lion, to rest a crown upon your head."
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"And the cub said, ""Will I be strong and fierce like my father?"""
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"Yes,"" said his mother. ""You will be strong and fierce just like your father."
Episode 9,cersei lannister,"I will keep you safe, my love. I promise you."
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,"Stand and fight! Stand and fight, damn you!"
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,No!
Episode 9,cersei lannister,Father.
Episode 9,tywin lannister,The battle is over. We have won.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Pod.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Pod! Find Bronn or Varys. Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle. Tell them I am very much alive.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,What happened?
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Where am I?
Episode 10,tywin lannister,"Thank you, Your Grace."
Episode 10,petyr baelish,"You honor me beyond words, Your Grace. I shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons."
Episode 10,cersei lannister,"Your Grace, in the judgment of your Small Council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne as we speak. For the good of the realm, your councilors beg you to set Sansa Stark aside."
Episode 10,petyr baelish,My lady. My sincerest condolences.
Episode 10,sansa stark,They're right. I'm not good enough for him.
Episode 10,petyr baelish,"You shouldn't say that. You'll be good enough for many things. He'll still enjoy beating you. And now that you're a woman, he'll be able to enjoy you in other ways as well."
Episode 10,sansa stark,"But, if he's not marrying me-"
Episode 10,petyr baelish,"He'll let you go home? Joffrey's not the sort of boy who gives away his toys. You have a tender heart, just like your mother did at your age. I can see so much of her in you. She was like a sister to me. For her sake, I'll help get you home."
Episode 10,sansa stark,King's Landing is my home now.
Episode 10,petyr baelish,Look around you. We're all liars here. And every one of us is better than you.
Episode 10,varys,"No need for that, my dear."
Episode 10,varys,I'm not like most men.
Episode 10,varys,I would like you to tell me if working for Lord Baelish has been all you'd hoped it would be.
Episode 10,varys,You wouldn't remember me if we had?
Episode 10,varys,And I think you remember all of them. I think your true talents are wasted on them.
Episode 10,varys,You're afraid. Why? Nothing dangerous down there.
Episode 10,varys,"And, unlike your current employer, I protect those who work for me. I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims or force them to abuse each other."
Episode 10,varys,I thought you said you knew who I was.
Episode 10,varys,Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes. I see a potential partner.
Episode 10,varys,"Oh, you should be. He's a dangerous man. But everyone has their weaknesses. Your current employer hides his very well, but not as well as he thinks."
Episode 10,jaime lannister,"You're a virgin, I take it?"
Episode 10,brienne,Walk.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,"Childhood must have been awful for you. Were you a foot taller than all the boys? They laughed at you, called you names? Some boys like a challenge. One or two must have tried to get inside Big Brienne."
Episode 10,brienne,One or two tried.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,"Ah. But you fought them off. But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes. But none of them were strong enough. I'm strong enough."
Episode 10,brienne,Not interested.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Of course you are. You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,"Ah. ""They lay with lions."" Tavern girls, I'd say. Probably served my father's soldiers. Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel. That's how they earned this. The glorious work of the Northern freedom fighters. Must make you proud to serve the Starks."
Episode 10,brienne,I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,What are you doing?
Episode 10,brienne,Burying them.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,We shouldn't stay here. We should get back on the river.
Episode 10,brienne,I think these women would understand if I don't care what you think.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Untie me. Now!
Episode 10,brienne,Traveling a prisoner.
Episode 10,brienne,If you've quite finished up-
Episode 10,brienne,"All right, we'll be going."
Episode 10,brienne,The Starks.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?
Episode 10,brienne,"No, stealing is a crime."
Episode 10,jaime lannister,But it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you.
Episode 10,brienne,To Riverrun.
Episode 10,brienne,"Steal from the Tullys, it's their dungeons you rot in."
Episode 10,jaime lannister,For stealing a pig?
Episode 10,brienne,I don't give the orders. He must be important to someone.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Have you been to Ashemark?
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Then you don't know me.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Is it near Ashemark?
Episode 10,jaime lannister,I've never been there.
Episode 10,brienne,I hope you gave them quick deaths.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,I wish someone had told me. I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.
Episode 10,brienne,"If this is the Kingslayer, I think I'd know about it."
Episode 10,brienne,"He's not the Kingslayer. Sorry to disappoint you. If he was, I'd only be traveling his head."
Episode 10,brienne,Two quick deaths.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Those were Stark men.
Episode 10,brienne,"I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn. I told you I'd take you to King's Landing, and that's what I'm going to do. Stay."
Episode 10,catelyn stark,Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross.
Episode 10,robb stark,I know that.
Episode 10,catelyn stark,And you mean to do it anyway?
Episode 10,robb stark,I love her.
Episode 10,catelyn stark,I know that seems important to you.
Episode 10,robb stark,It is important to me.
Episode 10,catelyn stark,"Your father didn't love me when we married. He hardly knew me or I him. Love didn't just happen to us. We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us. It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger. It lasts longer."
Episode 10,robb stark,"And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters, what you and father had?"
Episode 10,catelyn stark,Why not? Because she's not beautiful? Because she's not exotic and exciting?
Episode 10,robb stark,Now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it.
Episode 10,catelyn stark,"And you agreed to it. You gave him your word. Treat your oaths recklessly, and your people will do the same. If your father lived his life for one thing"
Episode 10,robb stark,My father is dead. And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless.
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,You said you saw my victory in the flames.
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,"The flames lied. And I'm no better than a savage trusting in a fire god. I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay. I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what? Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells. If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me?"
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,You claimed to speak for a god.
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,You talk about war as if you understand it.
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,Have you? Show me how you fight.
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,Show me.
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,Where's your god now? Will he save you? Where is your god?
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,I murdered my brother.
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,He wasn't your brother.
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,"You promise these things, but you don't know. None of us know."
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,I see fire.
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,Yes.
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,"I will kill that man. I don't care how many arrows they feather me with, how many spears they run through me, I will kill that horn-blowing cunt before I fall."
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,I know I'm surrounded. I know that because I stood on the battlements and saw I was surrounded.
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,"Thank you, wise bald man. Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me."
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,No word from my father?
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,Send more ravens.
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,The first time I saw Winterfell-
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,"First time I saw Winterfell, it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead. I saw it and I thought, ""Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers. ""We never stood a chance against the man who lives here."""
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,"Yes, my captors were so very kind to me. You love reminding me of that. Everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me of that. You know what it's like to be told how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner? To be told how much you owe them? And then to go back home to your real father"
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,"I will kill that man. I swear to the Drowned God, the Old Gods, the New Gods, to every fucking god in every fucking heaven, I will kill that man."
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,"And what's your counsel, trusted friend?"
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,"There's nowhere to run. I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands. And even if I did, even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home, I'd be a coward. The Greyjoy who ran. The shame of the family."
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,I won't make it to the Wall. I won't make it ten feet past the Winterfell gates.
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep.
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,"I've done a lot, haven't I? Things I never imagined myself doing."
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,You may be right. But I've gone too far to pretend to be anything else.
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,"You hear that? That's the mating call of the Northmen. They want to fuck us. Well, I haven't had a good fuck in weeks. I'm ready for one."
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,They say every Ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland.
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,You think they're right?
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,"We die today, brothers. We die bleeding from a hundred wounds with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts, but our war cries will echo through eternity. They will sing about the battle of Winterfell until the Iron Islands have slipped beneath the waves. Every man, woman and child will know who we were and how long we stood. Aggar and Gelmarr, Wex and Urzen, Stygg and Black Lorren. Ironborn warriors will cry out our names as they leap onto the shores of Seagard and Faircastle."
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,Mothers will name their sons for us.
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,Girls will think of us with their lovers inside them.
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,And whoever kills that fucking horn-blower will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke!
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,What is dead may never die!
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Why should I believe you?
Episode 10,varys,Why would I lie about it?
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,To create strife between my sister and me.
Episode 10,varys,"Where before there was nothing but love. Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sister's orders. If it weren't for your squire's bravery, you'd be a dead man."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"You're a good lad. Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times."
Episode 10,varys,I'm afraid your friend has been relieved of his command of the City Watch. The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father or your sister. It varies from cloak to cloak.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Then my hill tribesmen.
Episode 10,varys,"Have gone home. Your father paid them quite handsomely. I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other for some time, my lord."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Don't want to swim too close to a drowning man? And I thought we were friends.
Episode 10,varys,"We are. Podrick, would you mind?"
Episode 10,varys,"There are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat. The king won't give you any honors, the histories won't mention you, but we will not forget."
Episode 10,varys,"Come along now, Podrick."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,It was good of you to come.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"Believe me, you don't."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Well?
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,I'm a monster as well as a dwarf. You should charge me double.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,That was the arrangement we made. I pay you and you lie to me.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Leave?
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,What would we do in Pentos?
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,I want to go with you.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"I can't. I do belong here. These bad people are what I'm good at. Out-talking them, out-thinking them. It's what I am. And I like it. I like it more than anything I've ever done. Are you going to leave?"
Episode 10,robb stark,"Father, smith, warrior, mother ,maiden, crone, stranger."
Episode 10,robb stark,I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days.
Episode 10,jorah mormont,"No guards. The warlocks kill with sorcery, not steel."
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,Let them try.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,Is this a riddle?
Episode 10,jorah mormont,Khaleesi! Khaleesi!
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,Are you trying to frighten me with magic tricks? You want me? Here I am. Are you afraid of a little girl?
Episode 10,arya stark,What are you doing here?
Episode 10,arya stark,How did you know we'd come this way?
Episode 10,arya stark,How did you kill those guards? Was it hard?
Episode 10,arya stark,"Show me how. I want to be able to do it, too."
Episode 10,arya stark,Where?
Episode 10,arya stark,My dancing master was from Braavos.
Episode 10,arya stark,"I want to. But I can't. I need to find my brother and mother. And my sister. I need to find her, too."
Episode 10,arya stark,What is it?
Episode 10,arya stark,Could it buy a horse?
Episode 10,arya stark,Then what good is it?
Episode 10,arya stark,Valar Morghulis.
Episode 10,arya stark,"Please don't go, Jaqen."
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,"This is dark magic, like the magic that took you from me. Took you from me before I could even Maybe I am dead and I just don't know it yet. Maybe I am with you in the Night Lands."
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,That sounds like something you would do.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,"Until the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, until the rivers run dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves."
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,"This is not my home. My home is across the sea, where my people are waiting for me."
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,Dracarys.
Episode 10,jon snow,Careful with that. You might cut yourself.
Episode 10,jon snow,"Never swung a sword before, have you? You look like a baby with a rattle."
Episode 10,jon snow,Stop!
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,Come.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,Nothing.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. Thank you for teaching me this lesson."
Episode 10,jorah mormont,It's all a lie.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,Looks real enough to me. Real enough to buy a ship?
Episode 10,jorah mormont,"Aye, a small ship."
Episode 10,jorah mormont,Take all the gold and jewels.
Episode 10,sam,"If you step back and think about it, the thing about Gilly that's so interesting is"
Episode 10,sam,"No, truly. The thing about her that I find so interesting is that after all that Craster's done to her, she's still got hope that life might get better."
Episode 10,sam,And the thing about you that I find so interesting is absolutely nothing.
Episode 10,sam,It's Jon and the Halfhand. They're back.
Episode 10,sam,Wait! Wait for me!
Episode 10,sam,Grenn!
Episode 10,sam,Edd!
Episode 1,sam,Brother?
Episode 1,jon snow,Mance was a ranger.
Episode 1,jon snow,"When I'm free, will I be free to go?"
Episode 1,jon snow,What happened to their fathers?
Episode 1,jon snow,My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.
Episode 1,jon snow,Jon Snow.
Episode 1,jon snow,Your Grace.
Episode 1,jon snow,The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.
Episode 1,jon snow,He wants me to lead one day.
Episode 1,jon snow,"If I'm a traitor, then you are, too."
Episode 1,jon snow,I want to be free.
Episode 1,jon snow,We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north. I saw...
Episode 1,jon snow,I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it.
Episode 1,jon snow,"Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place?"
Episode 1,bronn,What if you took off that bit there?
Episode 1,bronn,"Trouble is, I've never had much imagination."
Episode 1,bronn,I didn't hear that.
Episode 1,bronn,Back away. Keep backing away till you're outside this establishment. Then back away some more.
Episode 1,bronn,"I will murder you, boy."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Pod?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,It's your sister. The queen.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,What are they doing here?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"Protecting me, I assume. Will you let me in?"
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"No, I don't think so."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"If I wanted to kill you, do you think I'd let a wooden door stop me?"
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,They stay outside.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"I'm not afraid of you, little brother."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Why are you here?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"I wanted to see your face. They said you'd lost your nose, but it's not as gruesome as all that."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,The man who cut me lost more than his nose.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"I should hope so. The rebels came for Joffrey's head, they lost their own. Thanks to Father."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Thanks to Father. Of course, it wasn't a rebel who tried to kill me."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,No? Curious. Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand. But then I don't suppose you need much room.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke. You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,You're meeting Father today?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,How do you know that?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ. The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two. Father told me. What do you want from him?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"What do I want from him? He's my father. Do I need to want something? I'm sure he loves me dearly, as any father loves his child, his baby boy. Yet he hasn't come to visit once since arriving in King's Landing. I lay here, my face split in half, but Father never came."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,You're going to make me cry.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Why do you care what I want from him?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Because you've slandered me to Father before.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Slandered? When?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"You did have your guards beat her. A girl of nine, I believe."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"I was nine, too."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"She lost an eye, if I remember correctly."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"If I remember correctly, she never stole a necklace again."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,It's not slander if it's true.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,And what's this truth you plan on telling him today?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Why are you so nervous about what I'm going to say to Father?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"Because you're a liar. I expect you'll tell lies about me, about Joffrey."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Any lies in particular?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"You're a clever man, but you're not half as clever as you think you are."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Still makes me more clever than you.
Episode 1,bronn,"Oh, look at these two shining warriors. Ser Taryn Mant and... Ser Whosit of Whocares."
Episode 1,bronn,Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
Episode 1,bronn,Pod.
Episode 1,bronn,"That's exactly who I am. And you're a grub in fancy armor who's better at beating little girls than fighting men. Now, I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion."
Episode 1,bronn,"As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine, your lordship, I am wondering why you sent for me."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,A number of people in this city want to kill me. You're here to protect me.
Episode 1,bronn,I've been doing that for a while now.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Do you grow bored protecting me?
Episode 1,bronn,I grow poor protecting you.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Poor? Poor? Under my patronage you've become a knight, you've served as Commander of the City Watch."
Episode 1,bronn,Briefly.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,I'm sure you filled your pockets.
Episode 1,bronn,"And now my pockets are empty. You've given me a taste for the finer things. And if you want me to carry on protecting you, you'll need to pay more."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,I thought we were friends.
Episode 1,bronn,We are. But I'm a sellsword. I sell my sword. I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,How much?
Episode 1,bronn,Double.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Double?
Episode 1,bronn,I'm a knight now. Knights are worth double.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,I don't even know how much I'm paying you now.
Episode 1,bronn,Which means you can afford it.
Episode 1,davos,Here. Here! Help me!
Episode 1,davos,I was in the battle at Blackwater. I was a captain and a knight.
Episode 1,davos,The one true king of Westeros... Stannis Baratheon.
Episode 1,davos,"No, the wildfire took him. I saw it."
Episode 1,davos,"If I was a good father, he'd still be here. Stannis lives?"
Episode 1,davos,Will you take me there?
Episode 1,davos,This war is not over.
Episode 1,davos,We're both sworn to King Stannis.
Episode 1,davos,Stannis never gives up. Never. Now he will regroup ...
Episode 1,davos,What?
Episode 1,davos,You're a smuggler.
Episode 1,davos,"Take me back there, please."
Episode 1,davos,"Maybe not, but I could carve her heart out."
Episode 1,davos,You call me friend. You drank with me on my wedding day.
Episode 1,davos,"I have to stop her. Please, do this for me."
Episode 1,robb stark,There won't be a siege. The Mountain can't defend a ruin.
Episode 1,robb stark,The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross. I'd love a fight. The men would love a fight. I don't think we're going to get one.
Episode 1,robb stark,A Mallister?
Episode 1,catelyn stark,Ser Jeremy. My father's bannerman.
Episode 1,robb stark,Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell.
Episode 1,robb stark,She freed Jaime Lannister. The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice.
Episode 1,robb stark,"What's your name, friend?"
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,The badge looks good on you. Almost as good as it looked on me. Are you enjoying your new position?
Episode 1,tywin lannister,Am I enjoying it?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,I was very happy as Hand of the King.
Episode 1,tywin lannister,Yes. I heard how happy you were.
Episode 1,tywin lannister,blows on his paper to dry the ink.
Episode 1,tywin lannister,You brought a whore into my bed.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,It wasn't your bed at the time.
Episode 1,tywin lannister,"I sent you here to advise the king. I gave you real power and authority. You chose to spend your days as you always have, bedding harlots and drinking with thieves."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Occasionally I drank with the harlots.
Episode 1,tywin lannister,"What do you want, Tyrion?"
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Why does everyone assume I want something? Can't I simply visit with my beloved father? My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield.
Episode 1,tywin lannister,Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal. I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family. And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell. But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start."
Episode 1,tywin lannister,"Jugglers and singers require applause. You are a Lannister. Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield? Hmm? Now, I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion. So tell me what you want."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"I want what is mine by right. Jaime is your eldest son, heir to your lands and titles. But he is a Kingsguard, forbidden from marriage or inheritance. The day Jaime put on the white cloak, he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock. I am your son and lawful heir."
Episode 1,tywin lannister,You want Casterly Rock?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,It is mine by right.
Episode 1,tywin lannister,"We'll find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay. And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy. And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife. And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Why?
Episode 1,tywin lannister,"Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go."
Episode 1,tywin lannister,"Oh, one more thing. The next whore I catch in your bed, I'll hang."
Episode 1,sansa stark,Dorne. It's going to Dorne.
Episode 1,sansa stark,It's carrying silk and it's supposed to bring back wine in exchange. But it's not coming back. The captain's tired of risking his life so King's Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve. He's going to stay in Dorne. Wait out the winter where it's beautiful and warm.
Episode 1,sansa stark,Don't ruin the game.
Episode 1,sansa stark,What about that one there?
Episode 1,sansa stark,Why?
Episode 1,sansa stark,That's not how the game works. You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer. You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.
Episode 1,sansa stark,Because the truth is always either terrible or boring.
Episode 1,petyr baelish,Lovely day for it. Watching the ships.
Episode 1,sansa stark,Lord Baelish.
Episode 1,petyr baelish,Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?
Episode 1,petyr baelish,I saw your mother not long ago. She's very eager to see you. And your sister.
Episode 1,sansa stark,Arya's alive? You said you'd take me home.
Episode 1,petyr baelish,You said King's Landing was your home. You are the property of the crown. Stealing you would be treason. If you were to tell just one person ...
Episode 1,sansa stark,I won't tell anyone.
Episode 1,petyr baelish,How do I know?
Episode 1,sansa stark,"Because I'm a terrible liar. You said so yourself. Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when."
Episode 1,petyr baelish,"I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital. When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me. But you'll need to be ready to leave on a moment's notice."
Episode 1,jorah mormont,They're growing fast.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Not fast enough. I can't wait that long. I need an army
Episode 1,jorah mormont,We'll be in Astapor by nightfall. Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,The greatest slave-soldiers in the world. The distinction means a good deal to some people.
Episode 1,jorah mormont,Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,It's too beautiful a day to argue.
Episode 1,jorah mormont,You're right. Another lovely day on the high seas.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,"Don't mock them. They're the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship. They followed me across the poison water. If they'll do it, others will. And with a true khalasar ..."
Episode 1,jorah mormont,"The Dothraki follow strength above all, khaleesi. You'll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong. And not before."
Episode 1,davos,Your Grace.
Episode 1,stannis baratheon,I heard you were dead.
Episode 1,davos,Not yet.
Episode 1,stannis baratheon,"I had hoped to speak to you alone, Your Grace."
Episode 1,stannis baratheon,We are alone.
Episode 1,davos,"Your Grace, you are the rightful king. Not only by blood. You're an honorable man, a just man. And there is still a war to fight."
Episode 1,stannis baratheon,I am fighting.
Episode 1,davos,By burning prisoners alive?
Episode 1,davos,"I do not judge people for the gods they worship. If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone."
Episode 1,davos,You are my enemy.
Episode 1,davos,This woman is evil! She's the mother of demons.
Episode 1,stannis baratheon,Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell.
Episode 1,davos,Your Grace!
Episode 1,davos,She will destroy us all!
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"Yes, it suits you perfectly. I imagine you might be rather cold."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen. Perhaps before. Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"An open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom if you're not careful, my dear. Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there. We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them. The king barely escaped with his life."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"You're right, of course. But you are your father's son. We can't all have a king's bravery."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,I'm sure she does.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,They may suit my needs. Tell me of their training.
Episode 1,jorah mormont,Even the bravest men fear death.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Tell the good master there is no need.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,"You take a babe from its mother's arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?"
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,How many do you have to sell?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Eight thousand dead babies.
Episode 1,jorah mormont,The Unsullied are a means to an end.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,"Once I own them, these men..."
Episode 1,jorah mormont,They're not men. Not anymore.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,"Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be?"
Episode 1,jorah mormont,Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you?
Episode 1,jorah mormont,You'll be fair to them. You won't mutilate them to make a point.
Episode 1,jorah mormont,You won't order them to murder babies. You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered. A great injustice has been done to them. Closing your eyes will not undo it.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,The warlocks.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,"I owe you my life, Ser."
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,You know this man?
Episode 1,jorah mormont,I know him as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen and as the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard.
Episode 2,jon snow,"Don't think too much, Bran."
Episode 2,jon snow,Relax your bow arm.
Episode 2,robb stark,Did you ever think you'd marry one?
Episode 2,robb stark,Never?
Episode 2,robb stark,Let me guess which one is the good news.
Episode 2,catelyn stark,I hadn't seen him in years. I don't even know how many.
Episode 2,robb stark,We'll travel to the funeral together. Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return.
Episode 2,catelyn stark,Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest?
Episode 2,catelyn stark,Something else?
Episode 2,robb stark,"By the time Bolton's bastard Ramsay got to Winterfell, the Ironborn were gone. They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch. And Bran and Rickon have not been found. They may have escaped. Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages."
Episode 2,catelyn stark,Have you received any demands?
Episode 2,robb stark,No.
Episode 2,catelyn stark,Have you heard anything from Theon at all?
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,Where am I? Who are you? What do you want?
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Do you know how long it's going to take us to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests?
Episode 2,brienne,Yes.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,So how shall we pass the time?
Episode 2,brienne,By putting one foot in front of the other.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,It's going to be a very dull walk.
Episode 2,brienne,I'm here to take you to King's Landing and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange. Dull is fine.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute. Trust me on this. People have been serving me since I was born. You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword."
Episode 2,brienne,"If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I'm sure she'll let me know. She's an honest woman."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,All the good it's done her.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,How did you come into Lady Stark's service? There's something we can talk about.
Episode 2,brienne,"Not your concern, Kingslayer."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,It had to be recently. You weren't with her at Winterfell.
Episode 2,brienne,How would you know?
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Because I visited Winterfell. I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.
Episode 2,brienne,Move.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Were you pledged to Stannis?
Episode 2,brienne,"Gods, no."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"Ah, Renly. Really? He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal."
Episode 2,brienne,Shut your mouth.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget. Could hardly escape the little tulip. Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks. I knew him far better than you."
Episode 2,brienne,"I knew him as well as anyone. As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything. He would have been a wonderful king."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Sounds like you quite fancied him.
Episode 2,brienne,I did not fancy him.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"Oh, gods, you did."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"Did you ever tell him? No, of course not. You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell. You're far too much man for him.
Episode 2,brienne,I'm not interested in foul rumors.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Unless they're about me. It's all true about Renly. His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court. It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks. They'd have never got him off it.
Episode 2,brienne,Shut your mouth!
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"I don't blame him. And I don't blame you, either. We don't get to choose who we love."
Episode 2,brienne,South. You?
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"No, you really can't."
Episode 2,brienne,And you.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,He knows who I am.
Episode 2,brienne,He doesn't.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Maybe you're right. But what if you're not? What if he tells someone?
Episode 2,brienne,We're not doing it. He's an innocent man.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?
Episode 2,cersei lannister,That's better. It makes you look very strong.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Looks like a Tyrell rose. Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown. Should be more than enough fabric.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Tell me what you think of her.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Margaery.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason. She dresses like a harlot for a reason. She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,You need to ask yourself
Episode 2,sansa stark,He didn't. He didn't want anything. He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.
Episode 2,sansa stark,Littlefinger's not in love with me.
Episode 2,sansa stark,He's too old.
Episode 2,sansa stark,No.
Episode 2,sansa stark,Why? What will you do? I will make him stop.
Episode 2,sansa stark,Send him in.
Episode 2,sansa stark,Ser Loras.
Episode 2,sansa stark,"You are too kind, Ser Loras. You probably don't remember the first time we met. At the Hando s tourney, you gave me your favor. A rose, a red rose."
Episode 2,sansa stark,"Thank you, Ser Loras."
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,"Kiss me, child."
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens. We're very sorry for your losses.
Episode 2,sansa stark,"And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery. He was very gallant."
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,"Gallant, yes. And charming and very clean. He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king."
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick. That does not make him wise. As to your fathead father-
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,"She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate. It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother. How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me. But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders. So here we are to see things through. What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes?"
Episode 2,sansa stark,Lemon cake's my favorite.
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,"So we've been told. Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me. I'm much less boring than these others."
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden?
Episode 2,sansa stark,I haven't had the pleasure.
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,"No great pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf. His father was an oaf as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him. And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse. Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey."
Episode 2,sansa stark,"I-, I-"
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,"You, you. Who else would know better? We've heard some troubling tales. Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you?"
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,Has he ripped out your tongue?
Episode 2,sansa stark,"Joff-King Joffrey, he-His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion"
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,"Yes, all Lannisters are lions. And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose. But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?"
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,Bring me some cheese.
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,The cheese will be served when I want it served. And I want it served now.
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,"Are you frightened, child? No need for that. We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you."
Episode 2,sansa stark,My father always told the truth.
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,"Yes, he had that reputation. And they named him traitor and took his head."
Episode 2,sansa stark,Joffrey. Joffrey did that. He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off. And he said that was mercy. Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,Go on.
Episode 2,sansa stark,I-I can't. I never meant-my father was a traitor. My brother as well. I have traitor's blood. Please don't make me say anymore.
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,"Speak freely, child. We would never betray your confidence, I swear it."
Episode 2,sansa stark,He's a monster.
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,Ah. That's a pity.
Episode 2,sansa stark,"Please, don't stop the wedding."
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,"Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen. Even so, we thank you for the truth. Ah, here comes my cheese."
Episode 2,robb stark,My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.
Episode 2,robb stark,My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there. We need his men.
Episode 2,robb stark,Have you lost faith in our cause?
Episode 2,robb stark,If you no longer believe-
Episode 2,robb stark,You don't think we can win?
Episode 2,robb stark,"Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?"
Episode 2,catelyn stark,You're afraid of her. And she knows it.
Episode 2,catelyn stark,No.
Episode 2,catelyn stark,You can't help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them. Only a mother can make them.
Episode 2,catelyn stark,Twice.
Episode 2,catelyn stark,After a fashion. I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall.
Episode 2,catelyn stark,"Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox. Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live. But it would be a very long night. So I sat with him all through the darkness. Listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering."
Episode 2,catelyn stark,"Jon Snow. When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him. I didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring up at me. So I prayed to the gods, take him away. Make him die. He got the pox. And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived. A murderer. I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother. A woman he didn't even know. So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us."
Episode 2,catelyn stark,And he lived. And I couldn't keep my promise. And everything that's happened since then all this horror that's come to my family it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child.
Episode 2,jon snow,Yes.
Episode 2,jon snow,I understand.
Episode 2,jon snow,You want to protect your people.
Episode 2,jon snow,No.
Episode 2,jon snow,What's wrong with him?
Episode 2,sam,No.
Episode 2,sam,I can't.
Episode 2,sam,You don't care.
Episode 2,sam,"You left me. When the white walkers came, you left me."
Episode 2,arya stark,Would you please shut up about it?
Episode 2,arya stark,I'm not listening.
Episode 2,arya stark,Shut up.
Episode 2,arya stark,"Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining?"
Episode 2,arya stark,Where are we going?
Episode 2,arya stark,"If we were going north, we should have come to the Red Fork River by now."
Episode 2,arya stark,"It's a hundred feet wide. How could we have passed it? If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun. My mother grew up there. My grandfather, he's a lord. He'll protect us."
Episode 2,arya stark,Shh.
Episode 2,arya stark,Don't.
Episode 2,arya stark,You go on down the road. Just keep on singing so we know where you are. Leave us be and I won't kill you.
Episode 2,arya stark,What friends?
Episode 2,arya stark,Who are you?
Episode 2,arya stark,"No, who do you fight for?"
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,We've spoken of this. You cannot come here.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Did anyone see you? No.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,You sure? My father does not make idle threats. Having you killed would be the high point of his week. You have to be absolutely certain.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,All right. What is this problem?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Baelish doesn't have friends.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Oh, Ros? The redhead?"
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I try to know as many people as I can. You never know which one you'll need.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Oh, please. All right, yes, I fucked her once. Twice."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger?"
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"We can't. Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old name."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I don't even want to talk about her.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Only because you're making me.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Hmm, yes."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Only if you stop. But you mustn't come here again.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Do you hear me? You've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people. Dangerous people.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,Stop! Stop!
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,About what?
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,I don't know what you want.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,What truth?
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,I took it to-I took it-
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,No one. I took it on my own.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,To take the North while it was vulnerable.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,Hold it. Rule it.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,Why did you do that?
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,I took it to bring glory to my house and my father.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,"Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I took it because I hated the Starks. I hated them for holding me prisoner. I wanted to hurt them."
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,What are you doing?
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,Please.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,"I'll tell you anything. Just take it off. Please. Please, just take it off."
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,Yara?
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,"No, don't go. Please, please. No, please don't leave me. Please, please. Please, please don't go! Please. Please. Don't leave me. Please don't go."
Episode 2,arya stark,I don't drink ale.
Episode 2,arya stark,We're not children.
Episode 2,arya stark,Gendry's a smith. He was apprenticed in the armory.
Episode 2,arya stark,Gendry stole us weapons.
Episode 2,arya stark,He knows how to use a sword and so do I.
Episode 2,arya stark,My brothers taught me.
Episode 2,arya stark,You'll free us?
Episode 2,jaime lannister,It's a tough decision - take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water.
Episode 2,brienne,"Silence, Kingslayer."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river."
Episode 2,brienne,Good luck.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas. Which will she choose?
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed.
Episode 2,brienne,Be quick about it.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,I need to rest.
Episode 2,brienne,Get up.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far. What do you call them?"
Episode 2,brienne,Get up now.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"Corns. I never used to get corns. Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,This heel is ruined. There's no way-
Episode 2,jaime lannister,I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Ooh. You move well for a great beast of a woman.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,You shouldn't grimace before you lunge. It gives away the game.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"Bit of a quandary for you. If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark. But if you don't kill me, I'm going to kill you."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"You're good. Graceless, but good."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,We enjoy a good fight. Gets our juices flowing. The Flayed Man of House Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.
Episode 3,robb stark,It's not about glory. Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.
Episode 3,robb stark,What value was the mill?
Episode 3,robb stark,Is he there now? Of course not.
Episode 3,robb stark,"I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him. I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad without a strategic thought in his head. I could have that head on a spike by now. Instead, I have a mill."
Episode 3,robb stark,Willem and Martyn Lannister are fourteen years old.
Episode 3,robb stark,Tywin Lannister has my sisters. Have I sued for peace?
Episode 3,robb stark,Do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father's brother's great-grandsons?
Episode 3,robb stark,How many men did you lose?
Episode 3,robb stark,We need our men more than Tywin needs his!
Episode 3,robb stark,You would have. Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient.
Episode 3,robb stark,You know who isn't? Tywin Lannister.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Intimate. Lovely table. Better chairs than the old small council chamber. Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it.
Episode 3,tywin lannister,What news of Jaime?
Episode 3,tywin lannister,"Twenty thousand unwashed Northerns have known about his escape for weeks. Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined. Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?"
Episode 3,varys,"We are trying, my lord."
Episode 3,tywin lannister,"Try harder. What do we have, then?"
Episode 3,varys,"Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully. In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name."
Episode 3,tywin lannister,"Well, let him have it. The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble. The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn."
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord. Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children. She has always been positively predisposed toward me."
Episode 3,petyr baelish,Titles do seem to breed titles.
Episode 3,tywin lannister,You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold. Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems. The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory. Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead. Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended."
Episode 3,tywin lannister,Fully agreed. Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Master of Coin?
Episode 3,tywin lannister,It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge.
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"I hope you're pleased. If you had armed me, they never would have taken us."
Episode 3,brienne,You were armed when we were taken.
Episode 3,jaime lannister,I was in chains if you recall. Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound.
Episode 3,brienne,"All my life I've been hearing, 'Jaime Lannister, what a brilliant swordsman.' You were slower than I expected. And more predictable."
Episode 3,jaime lannister,I've been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year.
Episode 3,brienne,And I'm a woman. I was still beating you.
Episode 3,jaime lannister,You were not beating me.
Episode 3,brienne,Maybe you were as good as people said once. Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name.
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped. More than once. None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman. You'd be wise not to resist."
Episode 3,brienne,Would I?
Episode 3,jaime lannister,They'll knock your teeth out.
Episode 3,brienne,You think I care about my teeth?
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"No, I don't think you care about your teeth. If you fight them, they will kill you. Do you understand? I'm the prisoner of value, not you. Let them have what they want. What does it matter?"
Episode 3,brienne,What does it matter?
Episode 3,jaime lannister,Close your eyes. Pretend they're Renly.
Episode 3,brienne,"If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist? You'd let them do what they wanted?"
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"If I was a woman, I'd make them kill me. But I'm not, thank the gods."
Episode 3,arya stark,Why are you helping him? He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend?
Episode 3,arya stark,What am I?
Episode 3,arya stark,"So I can walk away, then?"
Episode 3,arya stark,You remember the last time you were here?
Episode 3,arya stark,What are you doing? We're about to leave.
Episode 3,arya stark,Winterfell.
Episode 3,arya stark,I'm sure.
Episode 3,arya stark,What is it?
Episode 3,arya stark,That's the tail?
Episode 3,arya stark,"Good-bye, Hot Pie."
Episode 3,arya stark,"Hey, Hot Pie. It's really good."
Episode 3,catelyn stark,A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting we're at war.
Episode 3,catelyn stark,"I've missed you, Uncle. Father missed you, too, from the day you left. Maybe he never said it in so many words-"
Episode 3,catelyn stark,I'm glad you were with him. I wish to the gods I had been. Did you make peace in the end?
Episode 3,catelyn stark,"Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign, I'd see him off. 'Wait for me, little Cat,' he'd say. 'Wait for me and I'll come back to you.' And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting. I wonder how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell waiting for me to return. I will never see them again."
Episode 3,jon snow,It's only horses. No men.
Episode 3,jon snow,About three hundred.
Episode 3,jon snow,Do you think anyone got away?
Episode 3,sam,Ghost?
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,I can ride.
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,I'll make you a Lord of the Iron Islands for this.
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,You refuse to tell me where you're going?
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,How long will you be gone?
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,You're abandoning me.
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,Then serve me.
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,My enemies think they've destroyed me. They're laughing at me the way Renly laughed at me. I want Joffrey dead. I want Robb Stark dead. Make me another son.
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,Why?
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,I'm not so easily killed. Men have been trying for years.
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,I want you.
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,You told me your magic requires a king's blood.
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,I'm the one true king.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,To whom?
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Give me your water.
Episode 3,jorah mormont,"Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death."
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"Here, drink."
Episode 3,jorah mormont,And what is she to do for soldiers?
Episode 3,jorah mormont,"Is it 'we' already, Ser Barristan? If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it. That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done."
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents."
Episode 3,jorah mormont,"How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan?"
Episode 3,jorah mormont,Have you ever seen a war where innocents didn't die by the thousands?
Episode 3,jorah mormont,"I was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi. You know what I saw? Butchery. Babies, children, old men. More women raped than you can count. There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand. But the Unsullied are not men. They do not rape. They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so. If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead."
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"Do you disagree, Ser Barristan?"
Episode 3,jorah mormont,"Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, and Rhaegar died."
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?"
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,I wish I had known him. But he was not the last dragon.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,They did not. I want to buy them all.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Yes. eight thousand. And the ones still in training as well.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,I will have them all or take none. Many will fall in battle. I'll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,I have dragons. I'll give you one.
Episode 3,jorah mormont,"Khaleesi, please."
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,One.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Done.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"I'll take you as well, now. You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me. A token of a bargain well struck."
Episode 3,jorah mormont,"Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army."
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"You're both here to advise me. I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you'll be advising someone else. Is that understood?"
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Do you have a name?
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Do you have a family? A mother and a father you'd return to if you had the choice?
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,You belong to me now. It is your duty to tell me the truth.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment. Do you know what he said to me? 'Let me die.'
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience?
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,And what about you? You know that I'm taking you to war. You may go hungry. You may fall sick. You may be killed.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, all men must die. But we are not men."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,I'm surprised you're surprised. This is the safest place in the city.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Not for bastards.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"Thank you, my dear."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Pod. Pod. Take them outside. I'll be there in a moment.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Only my life. Not all that significant, I'm afraid."
Episode 3,petyr baelish,You should have him knighted.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,If only the Master of Coin had such power.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,If only. I owe you a significant debt. Our redheaded friend. You secured her release when the queen detained her.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Oh, that. Of course. A simple misunderstanding."
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,We don't. I did fuck her once.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,I know.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,But we don't.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,I know. But how would the queen get that idea?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Why don't you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position?
Episode 3,petyr baelish,Keep a low profile.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are."
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"Well, you are richer than I am."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Good point.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"They're only numbers. Numbers on paper. Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave. Trivial even. You want a real challenge? Try whores."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"I've tried quite a few. Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie."
Episode 3,bronn,"Come on, I'm here later. Come on."
Episode 3,bronn,"Tonight, then. Looks like dull reading."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,You think all reading is dull reading.
Episode 3,bronn,It's an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages.
Episode 3,bronn,Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he's really up to.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Unless he made it all up, yes. Podrick, do keep up."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Podrick.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable. Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Wonderful. Genna specializes in first-timers.
Episode 3,bronn,"She's not bad with second-timers, either."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say?"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spear handler herself. She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles. One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,She's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as 'my lord.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Be back in time for my supper.
Episode 3,bronn,"Pace yourself, lad."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician. Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold."
Episode 3,bronn,Let me guess. He's not a magician.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,No.
Episode 3,bronn,He's stealing it?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Worse, he's borrowing it."
Episode 3,bronn,What's wrong with that?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it. The crown owes millions to my father."
Episode 3,bronn,"Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne, I imagine he'll forgive that debt."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, you're strangely naive."
Episode 3,bronn,I've never borrowed money before. I'm not clear on the rules.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Well, ahem, the basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest."
Episode 3,bronn,And what if I don't?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Well, you have to."
Episode 3,bronn,But what if I don't?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"This is why I don't lend you money. Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about. It's the Iron Bank of Braavos. We owe them tens of millions. If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies. One way or another, they always get their gold back."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Ah, the return of the conquering hero. Does he have a little jaunt in his step?"
Episode 3,bronn,The lado s practically skipping.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,You were gone a long time. I trust you got your money's worth. Or should I say my money's worth?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Oh, it was a gift, Podrick. This is more than I give you in a year."
Episode 3,bronn,He's a squire. You don't pay him.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year."
Episode 3,bronn,Maybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.
Episode 3,bronn,What did you tell them?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,What did you do to them?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,And they seemed to like these things?
Episode 3,bronn,Of course they seemed to like it. They're paid to seem to like it.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Only they weren't paid.
Episode 3,bronn,"What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free?"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Is that what you're telling us?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Sit down, Podrick."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,We're going to need details. Copious details.
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on.
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,"No! No! No, no, no!"
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,"No, please! No, no, no! No, don't!"
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,"No, please! No! No!"
Episode 3,brienne,"My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth. Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me to deliver Ser Jaime to King's Landing."
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"You know who she is, don't you?"
Episode 3,jaime lannister,She's Brienne of Tarth. Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth. Heard of Tarth?
Episode 3,jaime lannister,They call it the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why? Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth. Sapphires are gemstones. The blue ones.
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight in sapphires if she's returned to him. But only if she's alive, her honor unbesmirched."
Episode 3,jaime lannister,Not defiled.
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"I hated to read as a child, but my father forced me to study the books every morning before I could practice with sword or horse. Two hours every day holed up in the maester's chambers. I learned a lot of fancy words."
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"You'll be a rich man till the end of your days. And your sons will be rich men and their sons after them. Lands, titles- you'll have them all. The North can't win this war. You're a smart man. You understand that. We have the numbers. We have the gold."
Episode 3,jaime lannister,Fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable. Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding.
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"Now that we're speaking together man to man, I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree. I'm not asking to be freed from my constraints, but if I could sleep lying down, my back would thank you for it. I'm not as young and resilient as I was once."
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"I'm famished, actually."
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"Well, I do like partridge."
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"Oh, yes. Yes, this will do nic- ah!"
Episode 3,jaime lannister,My father-
Episode 3,jaime lannister,Don't.
Episode 4,brienne,He's going to fall. He's going to fall off his horse. Someone help him.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"Water. Water. Please, water. Wa-water. Water, please. Please. Please."
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"If I die, you won't be getting-"
Episode 4,brienne,Stop!
Episode 4,varys,"Oh, Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,I hope we might speak. In confidence.
Episode 4,varys,"Oh, always in confidence."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,About the events of the Blackwater. Perhaps this is the wrong time?
Episode 4,varys,"Oh, no. It's a wonderful time."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to-
Episode 4,varys,End your life?
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid. Which is why I'm coming to you. I need proof."
Episode 4,varys,Proof? Will there be a trial?
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,I need to know.
Episode 4,varys,"I have no proof, only whispers. Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still?"
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,I don't know. Do I?
Episode 4,varys,"As a boy, I traveled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which-"
Episode 4,varys,You do not possess at the moment.
Episode 4,varys,"But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,The sorcerer.
Episode 4,varys,"Hello, my old friend. It's been a long time. I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it."
Episode 4,sam,I'm sorry. He's beautiful.
Episode 4,sam,He's beautiful. Does he have a name?
Episode 4,sam,Are you going to give him one?
Episode 4,sam,Gilly.
Episode 4,sam,I wanted you to have it.
Episode 4,catelyn stark,Brandon.
Episode 4,catelyn stark,How many times have I told you? No climbing.
Episode 4,catelyn stark,I want you to promise me. No more climbing.
Episode 4,catelyn stark,Promise me. Promise me! Promise me!
Episode 4,catelyn stark,"Promise me! Promise me, Bran! Promise me!"
Episode 4,varys,Is he very large?
Episode 4,varys,Extraordinary.
Episode 4,varys,We're talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple?
Episode 4,varys,What did he do to them?
Episode 4,varys,So what did they say?
Episode 4,varys,Huh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?
Episode 4,varys,"Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her. Sad, really. Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?"
Episode 4,varys,What makes you say so?
Episode 4,varys,Ah. You can read. Rare for a woman in your profession.
Episode 4,varys,Of course. I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?
Episode 4,varys,Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls?
Episode 4,varys,How do you know?
Episode 4,varys,Prodigies in odd places indeed.
Episode 4,arya stark,You murdered Mycah. The butchers boy. My friend. He was twelve years old. He was unarmed. And you rode him down. You slung him over your horse like he was some deer.
Episode 4,arya stark,That's a lie! I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"Is it done, then? They belong to me?"
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Unsullied!
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Forward march!
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Halt!
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,A dragon is not a slave.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, of the blood of Old Valyria. Valyrian is my mother tongue."
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"Unsullied! Slay the masters, slay the soldiers, slay every man who holds a whip, but harm no child. Strike the chains off every slave you see!"
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Dracarys.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"Unsullied! You have been slaves all your life. Today you are free. Any man who wishes to leave may leave, and no one will harm him. I give you my word. Will you fight for me? As free men?"
Episode 5,arya stark,Kill him!
Episode 5,arya stark,No! Let go of me! Let me go!
Episode 5,arya stark,Burn in hell!
Episode 5,jon snow,"There are four to a patrol- two builders to check for structural damage, two rangers to watch for enemies."
Episode 5,jon snow,"It varies. If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you."
Episode 5,jon snow,Three.
Episode 5,jon snow,Castle Black.
Episode 5,jon snow,Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and the Shadow Tower.
Episode 5,jon snow,A thousand.
Episode 5,jon snow,What happens to your eagle after I kill you? Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut or does he just flop dead to the ground?
Episode 5,jon snow,A thousand men.
Episode 5,jon snow,I don't need you to protect me.
Episode 5,jon snow,Give it back.
Episode 5,jon snow,Ygritte! Ygritte!
Episode 5,jon snow,Ygritte! Seven hells. Ygritte!
Episode 5,jon snow,Ygritte.
Episode 5,jon snow,We shouldn't.
Episode 5,jon snow,I don't know. I just wanted to kiss you there is all.
Episode 5,jon snow,You seemed to like it.
Episode 5,jon snow,There's been no one else. Only you.
Episode 5,jon snow,I was a man of the Night's Watch. How about you? Were you a maid?
Episode 5,jon snow,Who was he?
Episode 5,jon snow,"Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough. We'd best get back. Tormund-"
Episode 5,arya stark,You can't let him go. He's a murderer. He's guilty.
Episode 5,arya stark,You can't!
Episode 5,brienne,"Thank you, my lord."
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Lord Bolton.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Is there word from the capital?
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Will I die?
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Then you'll die. You're no maester. Where's your chain?
Episode 5,jaime lannister,I don't need my right hand to kill you.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Mmm.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,No milk of the poppy.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,I'll scream.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,I'll scream loudly.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Lord Baelish.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,Your Grace.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"Of course, Your Grace."
Episode 5,cersei lannister,I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crown's best interests at heart.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,I see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?
Episode 5,cersei lannister,My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"Myself, I often find them a hindrance."
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know. He's almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't. You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells. I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,I shall do my best.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Thank you. And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?
Episode 5,petyr baelish,I assure you that it will.
Episode 5,olenna tyrell,"Gods, boy, that's enough. We're not in a tavern."
Episode 5,olenna tyrell,No need to speak. Are there any figs? Fetch some. I always take figs midafternoon. They help move the bowels. To what do I owe this summons?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"Thank you for seeing me, my lady. I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters."
Episode 5,olenna tyrell,I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,It's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it.
Episode 5,olenna tyrell,Naturally.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,It's shaping up to be a very involved affair. The word extravagant has been used.
Episode 5,olenna tyrell,What good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,I understand that.
Episode 5,olenna tyrell,Good.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown. As of now, it's a huge expense."
Episode 5,olenna tyrell,And?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"And we're at war, Lady Olenna."
Episode 5,olenna tyrell,"Oh, I'd nearly forgotten."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"Yes, and maintaining supply lines-"
Episode 5,olenna tyrell,"I can't think how it slipped my mind. What is it, twelve thousand infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? Two thousand in support. Provisions so this city might survive the winter. A million bushels of wheat. Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye. Twenty thousand head of cattle. Fifty thousand sheep. You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses. I'm quite familiar with them."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.
Episode 5,olenna tyrell,"As is a royal wedding. The people are hungry for more than just food. They crave distractions. And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own. And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces. A royal wedding is much safer. Wouldn't you say?"
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,I would.
Episode 5,olenna tyrell,And traditionally paid for by the royal family.
Episode 5,olenna tyrell,"I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched. You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper. Where did you go for them, Volantis?"
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,My lady-
Episode 5,olenna tyrell,"Oh, very well. I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part. We'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned. Is that sufficient?"
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Quite sufficient. Thank you.
Episode 5,olenna tyrell,"Very good, then. That's settled. Good day."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Give me that.
Episode 5,arya stark,What are you doing?
Episode 5,arya stark,Why?
Episode 5,arya stark,"Have you lost your mind? When the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths? They'll cave your head in with your own helmet."
Episode 5,arya stark,You don't have to do this.
Episode 5,arya stark,"Robb needs good men, too. We're leaving tomorrow. And then you-"
Episode 5,arya stark,You just said you were serving Lord Beric.
Episode 5,arya stark,I can be your family.
Episode 5,robb stark,Bring them in.
Episode 5,robb stark,Is that all of them? It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?
Episode 5,robb stark,Vengeance? Those boys didn't kill your sons. I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen-
Episode 5,robb stark,They were boys! Look at them.
Episode 5,robb stark,My mother had nothing to do with this. This was your treason.
Episode 5,robb stark,Leave him.
Episode 5,robb stark,Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon. Hang the rest.
Episode 5,robb stark,This one was only the watcher. Hang him last so he can watch the others die.
Episode 5,robb stark,Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer?
Episode 5,robb stark,"I'm not fighting for justice if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn. He has to die."
Episode 5,catelyn stark,The Karstarks are Northmen. They won't forgive the killing of their lord.
Episode 5,robb stark,You tended to their wounds. You brought them supper. Now they're dead.
Episode 5,catelyn stark,Spare his life. Keep him as a hostage.
Episode 5,robb stark,That didn't stop you from betraying me. And it won't save you now.
Episode 5,robb stark,"Kneel, my lord."
Episode 5,robb stark,"Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, here in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die. Would you speak a final word?"
Episode 5,arya stark,Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. Ser Meryn. The Hound. What are you going to do with me?
Episode 5,arya stark,I'm a hostage and you're selling me.
Episode 5,arya stark,But it is that way.
Episode 5,arya stark,More is than isn't.
Episode 5,arya stark,So why don't you?
Episode 5,arya stark,No.
Episode 5,arya stark,I thought he killed you.
Episode 5,arya stark,But how?
Episode 5,arya stark,Could you bring back a man without a head? Not six times. Just once.
Episode 5,arya stark,I would. You're alive.
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,My lady.
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,I meant to come sooner. The battle-
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,"Yes, of course."
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,I believed that once.
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,Selyse. I've broken a sacred vow. I've sinned.
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,I've wronged you. I have shamed you.
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,You don't understand. The Red Woman- the Lady Melisandre-
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,That's not true.
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,She's my daughter. I want to see her.
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,Shireen.
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,You've grown since I last saw you.
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,No.
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,He did. He fought bravely.
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,"He won't be visiting, child."
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,Ser Davos is a traitor. He's rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime. Best forget him.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Not so hard. You'll scrub the skin off.
Episode 5,brienne,What are you doing here?
Episode 5,jaime lannister,I need a bath. Help me out of these rags.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Now get out.
Episode 5,brienne,There's another tub.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,"This one suits me fine. Don't worry. I'm not interested. If I faint, pull me out. I don't intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub."
Episode 5,brienne,Why should I care how you die?
Episode 5,jaime lannister,"You swore a solemn vow, remember? You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him."
Episode 5,jaime lannister,That was unworthy. Forgive me. You protected me better than most-
Episode 5,brienne,Don't you mock me.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,I'm apologizing. I'm sick of fighting. Let's call a truce.
Episode 5,brienne,You need trust to have a truce.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,I trust you.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,There it is. There's the look. I've seen it for seventeen years on face after face. You all despise me. Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. A man without honor. You've heard of wildfire?
Episode 5,brienne,Of course.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,"The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?"
Episode 5,jaime lannister,"First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. 'Burn them all,' he kept saying. 'Burn them all.' I don't think he expected to die. He- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me."
Episode 5,brienne,If this is true why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?
Episode 5,brienne,Help! Help! The Kingslayer!
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Jaime. My name is Jaime.
Episode 5,davos,"Princess? Gods, what are you doing here?"
Episode 5,davos,Bert?
Episode 5,davos,Go back to your room. You're not supposed to be here. If your father knew-
Episode 5,davos,"I am, child. I disobeyed my king, your father, and now I'm paying the price."
Episode 5,davos,Aye. So they did.
Episode 5,davos,"Thank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book, but it's wasted on me."
Episode 5,davos,"My lady, I can't read the words."
Episode 5,davos,No. No. No.
Episode 5,davos,Go. We can't.
Episode 5,davos,I wouldn't know where to start.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,It was a bitch of a siege.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,"The second. Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his."
Episode 5,jorah mormont,"Proudest moment of my life. One knee in the dust, the king's sword on my shoulder, listening to the words. 'In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.' All I could think of was how badly I had to piss."
Episode 5,jorah mormont,In full plate metal for sixteen hours. Never occurred to me till the fighting was over. I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king's boots.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,You swore an oath.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,With all my heart.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,These are the ones?
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,You did not choose this life. But you are free men now. And free men make their own choices. Have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks?
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,Remove your helmet
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,What is your name?
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,Grey Worm.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"From this day forward you will choose your own names. You will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same. Throw away your slave name. Choose the name your parents gave you, or any other. A name that gives you pride."
Episode 5,jorah mormont,King Robert wanted her dead.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,No? Doesn't the Lord of the Kingsguard traditionally-
Episode 5,jorah mormont,"Yeah, I imagine I would, too. Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings - and betrayals the world over."
Episode 5,jorah mormont,"Still, she'll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms."
Episode 5,jorah mormont,Which men do you have in mind?
Episode 5,jorah mormont,It suffered for a reason. I sold men into slavery.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,"Our cause? Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins while you were still bowing to the man."
Episode 5,jorah mormont,You only joined us a few days ago. I can't speak to your intentions.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,You're not Lord here. You're just another exile. And I take my orders from the queen.
Episode 5,robb stark,You were right.
Episode 5,robb stark,The Karstarks are gone. Almost half our forces. Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel. Nothing. Only wait.
Episode 5,robb stark,What can I do? Attack King's Landing? There's nothing he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day.
Episode 5,robb stark,"Winter could last five years. Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again. When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission. Now we're like a band of bickering children."
Episode 5,robb stark,What?
Episode 5,robb stark,Here. And we're here. King's Landing-
Episode 5,robb stark,"I can't force them to meet us in the field and I can't attack them where they're strongest, but I can attack them where they're not."
Episode 5,robb stark,And Casterly Rock can't run away. I'm going to take their home away from them.
Episode 5,robb stark,I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home. There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasn't already sided with the Lannisters. The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry- Walder Frey.
Episode 5,sansa stark,He's such a splendid fighter. Do you have any idea when we might
Episode 5,sansa stark,Joffrey won't let me leave. He's got too many reasons to keep me here.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,That didn't take long.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,Is he? And who's the lucky girl?
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"She may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but she's mine. I've always wanted a ship. Now I want a dozen. Strange, isn't it?"
Episode 5,sansa stark,What is?
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"It doesn't matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else. Your hair is different."
Episode 5,sansa stark,Is it?
Episode 5,petyr baelish,Lady Margaery wears it that way.
Episode 5,sansa stark,Many ladies wear it this way.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,I have good news. I'll be leaving the city soon.
Episode 5,sansa stark,You still want me to come with you?
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"It's not a question of what I want. It's what you want. You want to go home, don't you?"
Episode 5,sansa stark,"Of course. More than anything. But maybe it would be better to wait. I've been thinking how dangerous it would be. Not just for me, but for you. You've been so kind. I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you. I can't tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa. Your true friend."
Episode 5,sansa stark,"I do, Lord Baelish."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,Petyr.
Episode 5,sansa stark,Petyr.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"If you wish to stay, then of course you will stay."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,We'll speak again when I return.
Episode 5,tywin lannister,You're late.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,What's she doing here?
Episode 5,tywin lannister,"Our business concerns her, too. Sit."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"You'll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell, I've saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding."
Episode 5,tywin lannister,Never mind that now. We have something important to discuss.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,I'm Master of Coin. Saving money is important.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable.
Episode 5,tywin lannister,Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"Very well. She's a lovely girl. Missing some of Loras' favorite bits, but I'm sure they'll make do."
Episode 5,tywin lannister,Your jokes are not appreciated.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"It wasn't my best, but-"
Episode 5,tywin lannister,"I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother.
Episode 5,tywin lannister,The Karstarks have marched home. The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered. Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers. That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell. And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?
Episode 5,tywin lannister,There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot. Plots are not public knowledge. And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,And how do we do that?
Episode 5,tywin lannister,We find Sansa Stark a different husband.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Wonderful.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"Yes, it is."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,You can't mean it.
Episode 5,tywin lannister,I can and I do.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Joffrey has made this poor girl's life miserable since the day he took her father's head. Now she's finally free of him and you give her to me? That's cruel even for you.
Episode 5,tywin lannister,"Do you intend on mistreating her? The girl's happiness is not my concern, nor should it be yours."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,She's a child!
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"She's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length."
Episode 5,tywin lannister,"There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her. Surely you're capable of that."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,And if I refuse?
Episode 5,tywin lannister,You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle. Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for. And it is past time you were wed.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,I was wed. Or don't you remember?
Episode 5,tywin lannister,Only too well.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,You should be thanking the gods for this. This is more than you deserve.
Episode 5,tywin lannister,Tyrion will do as he's bid. As will you.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,What do you mean?
Episode 5,tywin lannister,You'll marry Ser Loras.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,I will not.
Episode 5,tywin lannister,"The boy is heir to Highgarden. Tyrion will secure the North, you will secure the Reach."
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"No, I won't do it."
Episode 5,tywin lannister,"Yes, you will. You're still fertile. You need to marry again and breed."
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"I am Queen Regent, not some broodmare."
Episode 5,tywin lannister,You're my daughter! You will do as I command and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumors about you once and for all.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"Father, don't make me do it again, please."
Episode 5,tywin lannister,Not another word. My children. You've disgraced the Lannister name for far too long.
Episode 6,sam,"But the more wood, the bigger the fire."
Episode 6,sam,Huh. You know your fires.
Episode 6,sam,"It doesn't get so cold down in the Reach. And there were servants, of course."
Episode 6,sam,"Oh, I found something at the Fist of the First Men. Buried treasure. Thousands of years old. I think."
Episode 6,sam,"I'm not sure that it does anything. It's beautiful, though, isn't it?"
Episode 6,sam,Not so far. A few more days.
Episode 6,sam,Bigger. So big you can't even see the top sometimes. It's hidden in clouds.
Episode 6,sam,"I'm not. It's seven hundred feet high, all made of ice. On a warm day you can see it weeping. Castle Black is nice enough. They keep a fire burning in the long hall day and night. And Hobb makes venison stew with onions. Very tasty. Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing. Dareon sings best."
Episode 6,sam,"No. No, no, no. Not very well."
Episode 6,sam,"Oh, all right. Let's see."
Episode 6,sam,"Oh ahem. The father's face is stern and strong / He sits and judges right from wrong / He weighs our lives, the short and long / And loves the little children / The mother gives the gift of life / And watches over every wife / Her gentle smile ends all strife /And she loves her little children."
Episode 6,jon snow,You ever climbed it before?
Episode 6,jon snow,Aren't you?
Episode 6,jon snow,You kill someone for them?
Episode 6,jon snow,Can we not talk about that here?
Episode 6,jon snow,Did I seem scared the other day?
Episode 6,jon snow,Only in the beginning.
Episode 6,jon snow,What secret?
Episode 6,jon snow,I won't.
Episode 6,arya stark,Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne.
Episode 6,arya stark,"Face, tits, balls- I hit 'em right where I wanted to."
Episode 6,arya stark,What?
Episode 6,arya stark,But I have to aim.
Episode 6,arya stark,Never aim?
Episode 6,arya stark,There's someone out there.
Episode 6,arya stark,I don't like that woman.
Episode 6,arya stark,What does that have to do with anything?
Episode 6,arya stark,What are you doing? Let go of him.
Episode 6,arya stark,Tell them to stop. Come on. He wants to be one of you. He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them!
Episode 6,arya stark,Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she?
Episode 6,arya stark,You're not doing this for your god. You're doing it for gold.
Episode 6,arya stark,You're a witch. You're going to hurt him.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,Wa-
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,Please.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"I'll tell you everything, please."
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"If I win, you'll let me go?"
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,The North.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,Deepwood Motte.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,Last Hearth.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,Karhold!
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,No. It was just a guess.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,Torrhen Karstark.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,He was your brother. Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,You swore to tell me if I-
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's bannerman. I betrayed Robb. That's why you're torturing me.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"Please, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off!"
Episode 6,robb stark,Thank you for riding here so quickly. I know travel isn't easy in these times.
Episode 6,robb stark,Of course. He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.
Episode 6,robb stark,We are fighting for the North. Harrenhal is not in the North. It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it.
Episode 6,robb stark,We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.
Episode 6,robb stark,He has every right to be. Please excuse us while we discuss it.
Episode 6,robb stark,He's a proud man and we've wounded him.
Episode 6,robb stark,"It's all right. You heard him. If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead."
Episode 6,catelyn stark,You're willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?
Episode 6,robb stark,I have a war to fight. We can't win it without them. I have no time to haggle. You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.
Episode 6,robb stark,"I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war. If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost."
Episode 6,robb stark,"You're paying for my sins, Uncle. It's not fair or right. I'll remember it."
Episode 6,brienne,"Yes. Most kind of them. You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton. I am acting on Lady Stark's orders to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing."
Episode 6,jaime lannister,"You should. But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner. Why might that be?"
Episode 6,jaime lannister,We both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.
Episode 6,jaime lannister,"It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it."
Episode 6,jaime lannister,He'll make time for you.
Episode 6,jaime lannister,Shall we drink on it?
Episode 6,jaime lannister,You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?
Episode 6,jaime lannister,"Very well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident."
Episode 6,brienne,I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to-
Episode 6,jaime lannister,I'm afraid I must insist.
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,Impossible.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Why?
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,My grandson is the pride of Highgarden. The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms. Your daughter-
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king."
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,Old.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Old?
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,"Old. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"The years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities. Do you deny them?"
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,"Oh, not at all. A sword swallower through and through."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,"Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?"
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Of course.
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,And you never-
Episode 6,tywin lannister,No.
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,Not once? Not in any way?
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Never.
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,"I congratulate you upon your restraint. But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,"I wouldn't say that. True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters- where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,"Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,I don't care what people believe. And neither do you.
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,"As an authority on myself, I must disagree."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt."
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,"And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt. It is a chance we simply cannot take."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. All right. I'll remove it for you.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard. I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows. He will never marry. He will never have children."
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,Oh
Episode 6,tywin lannister,The Tyrell name will fade. And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?"
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,It's a rare enough thing- a man who lives up to his reputation.
Episode 6,jon snow,Take my hand!
Episode 6,sansa stark,That's a wonderful pin.
Episode 6,sansa stark,I'm very happy about
Episode 6,sansa stark,I feel like I'm in a dream.
Episode 6,sansa stark,No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,We can have them both killed.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,Father doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,On a boat you built.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,"I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot."
Episode 6,cersei lannister,What do you want me to say?
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,"Not the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"You may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels."
Episode 6,cersei lannister,"When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked."
Episode 6,cersei lannister,Who's going to tell her?
Episode 6,sansa stark,Do you think people will like it?
Episode 6,sansa stark,"You're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding. Loras likes green and gold brocade."
Episode 6,sansa stark,Will they let me invite my family?
Episode 6,sansa stark,But do you think they will?
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"I beg your pardon, my lady."
Episode 6,sansa stark,"Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa."
Episode 6,sansa stark,Of course.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Alone, if I may."
Episode 6,sansa stark,"Shae. Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.
Episode 6,sansa stark,"It's all right, really."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,How to begin? It's- this- this- this is awkward.
Episode 6,varys,"A thousand blades taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread."
Episode 6,petyr baelish,There aren't. There aren't even two hundred. I've counted.
Episode 6,varys,"Ha, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing. Yet it has a certain appeal. The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice."
Episode 6,petyr baelish,"Early days, my friend. It is flattering, really, you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want."
Episode 6,varys,"Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you. Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?"
Episode 6,petyr baelish,"You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience."
Episode 6,varys,I did what I did for the good of the realm.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,The realm? Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies. A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie.
Episode 6,varys,But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,"And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is."
Episode 7,jon snow,"About a week, I think."
Episode 7,jon snow,"When we went to Castle Black, we took the Kingsroad."
Episode 7,jon snow,"Most of the time, yes."
Episode 7,jon snow,"They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil."
Episode 7,jon snow,Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.
Episode 7,jon snow,They help the men march.
Episode 7,jon snow,"Well, it's- it's the rhythm."
Episode 7,jon snow,"No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming."
Episode 7,jon snow,I know you cut me loose on the Wall.
Episode 7,jon snow,And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?
Episode 7,robb stark,Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.
Episode 7,catelyn stark,Lord Walder is prickly by nature.
Episode 7,catelyn stark,"Yes, and that is why-"
Episode 7,catelyn stark,Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.
Episode 7,catelyn stark,He's getting a wedding. It was a king he wanted.
Episode 7,robb stark,Edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house. We should all get some sleep.
Episode 7,robb stark,"If you don't put some clothes on, I can't promise I won't attack you again."
Episode 7,robb stark,Who are you writing?
Episode 7,robb stark,Is that Valyrian?
Episode 7,robb stark,Gaaa? Say hello for me.
Episode 7,robb stark,Ritsas.
Episode 7,robb stark,Does she know her daughter's a queen?
Episode 7,robb stark,"That will be a surprise, I expect."
Episode 7,robb stark,How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you're over there looking like that?
Episode 7,robb stark,I will.
Episode 7,robb stark,"What, now? Are you certain?"
Episode 7,robb stark,Angry? You're my queen.
Episode 7,robb stark,Maybe one of each.
Episode 7,robb stark,I love you. Do you hear me? I love you.
Episode 7,sansa stark,"Growing up at Winterfell, all I ever wanted was to escape, to come here to the capital. See the southern knights and their painted armor and King's Landing after dark- all the candles burning in all those windows. I'm stupid. A stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns."
Episode 7,sansa stark,How do I make the best of my circumstances? I have to marry him.
Episode 7,sansa stark,No.
Episode 7,sansa stark,He's tried.
Episode 7,sansa stark,He's a Lannister.
Episode 7,sansa stark,I'm sorry. Here I am complaining to you.
Episode 7,sansa stark,My son with him. I'll have to- we'll have to-
Episode 7,sansa stark,I'm not afraid of the pain. Not after what Joffrey's done to me.
Episode 7,sansa stark,He's a dwarf. And Loras- Loras.
Episode 7,sansa stark,And that's a good thing?
Episode 7,sansa stark,How do you know all this? Did your mother teach you?
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,She's a child.
Episode 7,bronn,She's a foot taller than you.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,A tall child.
Episode 7,bronn,What's the youngest you've ever had?
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,Not that young.
Episode 7,bronn,How much older?
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,Older.
Episode 7,bronn,"You're a lord, she's a lady. And a beauty at that. I don't see the problem."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,Shae isn't going to like it.
Episode 7,bronn,Shae is a whore. Are you gonna marry her? Eh? How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,I should never have told you about that.
Episode 7,bronn,"You want Shae, keep her. Wed one and bed the other. All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl. He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day. You can rule the North in his name. You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them.
Episode 7,bronn,"You waste time trying to get people to love you, you'll end up the most popular dead man in town. You want to fuck that Stark girl. You just don't want to admit it."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head. The ones already there don't need company.
Episode 7,bronn,You pay me to kill people who bother you. Evil notions come free.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,Your Grace.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,You wanted to speak to me?
Episode 7,tywin lannister,"You're welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace. Any or all of them."
Episode 7,tywin lannister,Of course.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,"I have, yes."
Episode 7,tywin lannister,"The Tower of the Hand is where I work. To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively."
Episode 7,tywin lannister,We could arrange to have you carried.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,Where did you hear about this?
Episode 7,tywin lannister,Apparently so.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,"When I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room. The skull of the last of them was right here. It was the size of an apple."
Episode 7,tywin lannister,"Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago. Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us."
Episode 7,tywin lannister,Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,You are being counseled at this very moment.
Episode 7,tywin lannister,"From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary. Your Grace."
Episode 7,jorah mormont,Yunkai. The Yellow City.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,"On the field, with ease. But they won't meet us on the field. They have provisions, patience, and strong walls. If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,I don't want half my army killed before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,"We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi. Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,How many slaves are there in Yunkai?
Episode 7,jorah mormont,Two hundred thousand if not more.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Then we have Two hundred thousand reasons to take the city.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"Send a man to the city gates. Tell the slavers I will receive them here, and accept their surrender. Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,You may approach. Sit.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Good. My Unsullied need practice. I was told to blood them early.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,My ship?
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,And what do you ask in return?
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,I have a gift for you as well. Your life.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"And the lives of your wise masters. But I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai. Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude. Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"I did, but my dragons made no promises. And you threatened their mother."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"My gold. You gave it to me, remember? And I shall put it to good use. You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you. Now get out."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,And what happens to things that don't bend? He said he had powerful friends. Who was he talking about?
Episode 7,jorah mormont,I don't know.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Find out.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport. Smithed in Casterly Rock.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,You could buy a ship with these.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,What?
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,Of course you're not going anywhere.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,I didn't ask for this marriage. I didn't want it.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"That doesn't mean that- this is duty, not desire."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,I don't have a choice. My father-
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,My feelings for you have not changed. I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,I swear to you it will not be like that.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city. You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants. Any children we might have will be well provided for."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"Listen. Listen to me, my lady."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,You are. You'll always be my lady.
Episode 7,arya stark,I don't talk to traitors.
Episode 7,arya stark,But you did. You took the gold and you gave him up.
Episode 7,arya stark,He's not my one true god.
Episode 7,arya stark,Death.
Episode 7,arya stark,But what about Riverrun? It's not south. It's west of here.
Episode 7,arya stark,You swore.
Episode 7,arya stark,Why? So you can steal their gold?
Episode 7,arya stark,"I don't care what you swear because you're a liar. You lied to Gendry, you lied to me. You'll lie to anyone. I hope the Lannisters kill you all."
Episode 7,brienne,I thought you were gone.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Tomorrow.
Episode 7,brienne,Have they told you what they plan to do with me?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Lord Bolton's traveling tomorrow as well. He's going to the Twins for Edmure Tully's wedding. You're to remain here.
Episode 7,brienne,With Locke?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,I owe you a debt.
Episode 7,brienne,"When Catelyn Stark released you, we both made a promise to her. Now it's your promise. You gave your word. Keep it and consider the debt paid."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,I will return the Stark girls to their mother. I swear it.
Episode 7,brienne,"Good-bye, Ser Jaime."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,My father will make him Grand Maester if he grows me a new hand.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Tell Robb Stark I'm sorry I couldn't make his uncle's wedding. The Lannisters send their regards.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,Where is he?
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,Please.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,He sent you.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,Help me. If he comes back-
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,"Please. No. No! Mercy, please! Please, mercy! Mercy!"
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,"No! No! No! Please, no! No! No! No, please! Please!"
Episode 7,jon snow,You're gonna scare it off.
Episode 7,jon snow,It's too far away.
Episode 7,jon snow,It's a windmill.
Episode 7,jon snow,Just the men who used to live here.
Episode 7,jon snow,Winterfell has towers three times that size.
Episode 7,jon snow,"If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell."
Episode 7,jon snow,Fainting.
Episode 7,jon snow,When a girl sees blood and collapses.
Episode 7,jon snow,Well not all girls are like you.
Episode 7,jon snow,I'd like to see you in a silk dress.
Episode 7,jon snow,So I could tear it off you.
Episode 7,jon snow,Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.
Episode 7,jon snow,"Ygritte. You won't win. I know your people are brave, no one denies that."
Episode 7,jon snow,"Six times in the last thousand years, a King has attacked the kingdoms. Six times they failed."
Episode 7,jon snow,"Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same."
Episode 7,jon snow,You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together.
Episode 7,jon snow,"I do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you."
Episode 7,jon snow,"Yes, first we'll live."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"Yes, we've stymied the corruption. You're a learned man."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,You did well sewing up this mess. You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,What is?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,You performed experiments on living men.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,With their permission?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"Dying paupers, I assume. Men with no families to complain. You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,I don't know.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Countless has a nice ring to it.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Half a million. The population of King's Landing. You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal. Did you- did you get a bird off to Brienne's father in Tarth?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,A fair offer.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Why not?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,They'd be fools to kill her.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,We have to return to Harrenhal.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,I've left something behind.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,And what are those orders?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,You think you'll get a reward.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"You think you're getting a reward. Let me explain something to you. When my father sees me, the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand. And I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Or I could tell him this man saved my life. We return to Harrenhal now.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Whoa.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Be quiet.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,A wooden sword?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,You gave her a wooden sword.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"I'll pay her bloody ransom. Gold, sapphires, whatever you want. Just get her out of there."
Episode 7,brienne,Ah!
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Get behind me.
Episode 7,brienne,I will not.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Pull her up.
Episode 7,brienne,Hold my legs.
Episode 7,brienne,Pull him up!
Episode 7,jaime lannister,We're taking her to King's Landing. Unless you kill me.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton? Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"Well, we must be on our way. Sorry about the sapphires."
Episode 8,arya stark,There's no one worse than you.
Episode 8,arya stark,You're lying.
Episode 8,arya stark,Is that the Blackwater?
Episode 8,arya stark,Back to King's Landing to Joffrey and the queen.
Episode 8,arya stark,But why?
Episode 8,arya stark,Why would they be at the Twins?
Episode 8,jorah mormont,They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid. The Yunkish are paying them well.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,You know these men?
Episode 8,jorah mormont,"Only by the broken swords on their banners. They're called the Second Sons. A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, ""The Titan's Bastard."""
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Is he more titan or bastard?
Episode 8,jorah mormont,"He's a dangerous man, khaleesi. They all are."
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,How many?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Enough to make a difference?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,It's hard to collect wages from a corpse. I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.
Episode 8,jorah mormont,I imagine you're right.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.
Episode 8,jorah mormont,He may not agree to meet.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,He will. A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.
Episode 8,jorah mormont,Mind your tongue.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,We have no slaves here.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,"Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded. Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?"
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,"We have more, don't we?"
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,"I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us."
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,You're very young to be a captain.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,"Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds don't favor your side."
Episode 8,jorah mormont,The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Or you could fight for me.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,I would pay you as much and more.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Ride with me and you'll never need another contract. You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,"A fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons. You have two days to decide."
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,These men are our guests. You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,"A barrel, then."
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,"Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first."
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,"Half Robert, half lowborn."
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,What do you mean to do with him?
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,"Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes? If it needs to be done, do it. Don't torture the boy."
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,No.
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,You've slaughtered many lambs?
Episode 8,davos,"And tho- and thowg V-v-visenya Targaryen rod- rode Vhagar- Vhag-' Fuck me. 'Visenya Targaryen rode Vhagar, the smallest of the dragons, though still large enog- enough- enough to swallow a horse whole."
Episode 8,davos,Your Grace.
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,They feeding you enough?
Episode 8,davos,"Two meals a day. Cold for breakfast, hot for supper. I cannot complain."
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,You don't belong in a place like this.
Episode 8,davos,"Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse."
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,Yeah.
Episode 8,davos,I'm sorry about your son. Didn't get the chance to tell you before. Good lad. Loyal lad.
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,Melisandre's returned.
Episode 8,davos,I didn't know she'd been gone.
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,Came back with a bastard boy. Robert's bastard boy.
Episode 8,davos,Why?
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,She says there's power in king's blood.
Episode 8,davos,She's going to kill him.
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,Sacrifice him.
Episode 8,davos,"Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice? The boy is your nephew."
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,What of it? We're at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?
Episode 8,davos,Because he has your blood in his veins.
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,So did Renly.
Episode 8,davos,"Renly wronged you. Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you. He raised an army, stole your bannermen. This boy has done you no harm. He's an innocent."
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,"How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women?The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. Unless I triumph. I never asked for this. No more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no? Great or small, we must do our duty. What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?"
Episode 8,davos,"Your Grace, why did you come to see me today?"
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,I came to free you. If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.
Episode 8,davos,I swear it. I can't swear never to speak against her.
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,You have little regard for your own life.
Episode 8,davos,"Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I'd counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself. You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory. When my son was five he said to me, 'I don't ever want to die. ' I wanted to say to him, 'You won't, child. You won't ever.' I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid. I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night."
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,"I saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?"
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Lady Sansa.
Episode 8,sansa stark,"You look very handsome, my lord."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Oh, yes. The husband of your dreams. But you do look glorious. Perhaps we could have a moment alone. Do you mind? Podrick, could you escort Lady Stark's handmaiden?"
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"My lady, I want you to know I didn't ask for this."
Episode 8,sansa stark,"I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"No, don't. You don't have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore. You won't be a prisoner after today. You'll be my wife. I suppose that's a different kind of prison. I just wanted to say- I'm just trying to say, very badly- I just- just want to say I know how you feel."
Episode 8,sansa stark,"I doubt that very much, my lord."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,You're right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you. Do you drink wine?"
Episode 8,sansa stark,When I have to.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Well, today you have to."
Episode 8,cersei lannister,Radiant? Why radiant?
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"You're a musical girl, aren't you? I imagine you have a lovely voice."
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"Ah, but you know the song 'The Rains of Castamere'?"
Episode 8,cersei lannister,So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?
Episode 8,cersei lannister,House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now?"
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"Gone. A gentle word. Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword."
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. 'And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear.'"
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"If you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep."
Episode 8,sansa stark,What are you doing?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Could you-
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Thank you.
Episode 8,stannis baratheon,The usurper Robb Stark. The usurper Balon Greyjoy. The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
Episode 8,olenna tyrell,"So their son will be your nephew. After you're wed to Cersei, of course. And you will be the king's stepfather and brother-in-law. When you marry the king, Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law and your son will be Loras' nephew? Grandson? I'm not sure. But your brother will become your father-in-law. That much is beyond dispute."
Episode 8,sansa stark,"Will you pardon me, my lord?"
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Of course. Of course. En-enjoy.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,Stay.
Episode 8,tywin lannister,You seem rather drunk.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Rather less than I plan to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?
Episode 8,tywin lannister,"This isn't about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,And?
Episode 8,tywin lannister,"If you're going to give her one, you need to perform."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,What did you once call me? A drunken little lust-filled beast.
Episode 8,tywin lannister,More than once.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit."
Episode 8,tywin lannister,"You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty."
Episode 8,cersei lannister,Nobody cares what your father once told you.
Episode 8,sansa stark,"Thank you, Your Grace."
Episode 8,sansa stark,"Yes, Your Grace."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,There will be no bedding ceremony.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.
Episode 8,tywin lannister,"I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace. I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won't even know I'm there."
Episode 8,tywin lannister,"Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,I am. Guilty. But- but it is my wedding night.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree? Come, I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood."
Episode 8,sansa stark,"Is that wise, my lord?"
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion."
Episode 8,sansa stark,"Is that wise, Tyrion?"
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Nothing was ever wiser.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Astoundingly long.
Episode 8,sansa stark,What?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly?
Episode 8,sansa stark,Fourteen.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Well, talk won't make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Stop. I can't. I could, I won't."
Episode 8,sansa stark,But your father-
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to."
Episode 8,sansa stark,What if I never want you to?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,And so my watch begins.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Ninteen
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,How can anyone speak nineteen languages?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, well, it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope- what do you mean reasonably well?"
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Drogo said I spoke Dothroaki like one born to it. It gave him great pride.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Athjahaka.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Athjahakar.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,"Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice."
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,What do you want?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Let her go.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,You were sent here to kill me?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,So why haven't you?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,What do your captains have to say about that?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Why?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Over what?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,You're a strange man.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,And this is supposed to impress me?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Will you fight for me?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Swear to me.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,You really ought to knock.
Episode 8,sam,It's getting dark. We could stay here for the night.
Episode 8,sam,How hard can it be to build a fire?
Episode 8,sam,He winked at me before.
Episode 8,sam,I saw him wink at me.
Episode 8,sam,I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink.
Episode 8,sam,"Well, I mean, there's no real difference."
Episode 8,sam,You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.
Episode 8,sam,What? No. This is just the way I talk.
Episode 8,sam,Don't you think he should have a name?
Episode 8,sam,"Let's see, there's Duncan, Kevan, Jo,n Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer."
Episode 8,sam,"Uh, yes. Maybe that's not-"
Episode 8,sam,"That's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name."
Episode 8,sam,"Well, it's a family name. For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly. Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name. You see? So my father is also a Tarly."
Episode 8,sam,"No, Randyll Tarly."
Episode 8,sam,Please don't name him Randyll.
Episode 8,sam,Different manner of cruel.
Episode 8,sam,I'll be back. I just want to look.
Episode 8,sam,Go inside. Go back inside. I'll-
Episode 8,sam,Stay back!
Episode 8,sam,You stay back!
Episode 9,catelyn stark,Are you sure about this?
Episode 9,robb stark,No.
Episode 9,catelyn stark,It's dangerous.
Episode 9,robb stark,"If we take Tywin's castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize he's not invincible. Take his home, take his gold, take his power."
Episode 9,catelyn stark,Why are you telling me?
Episode 9,robb stark,You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice.
Episode 9,robb stark,Now Winterfell is burned to the ground. The North is overrun with Ironborn and Bran and Rickon are gone.
Episode 9,robb stark,"So, Casterly Rock? I'm asking your advice."
Episode 9,catelyn stark,We have enough men?
Episode 9,robb stark,If Walder Frey cooperates.
Episode 9,catelyn stark,"If reinforcements arrive from King's Landing, before we take the castle, we'll be caught between Tywin's army and the sea."
Episode 9,robb stark,We'll lose the war and die the way father died. Or worse.
Episode 9,catelyn stark,Show them how it feels to lose what they love.
Episode 9,robb stark,"We thank you for your hospitality, my lord."
Episode 9,robb stark,"I have come to make my apologies, my lord, and to beg your forgiveness."
Episode 9,robb stark,"My ladies. All men should keep their word, kings most of all. I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow. The fault is not with you. Any man would be lucky to have any one of you. I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another. I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house. I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends."
Episode 9,robb stark,"Thank you, my lord."
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,Where?
Episode 9,jorah mormont,Your men but not you?
Episode 9,jorah mormont,"Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army. The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won't have to split it three ways cause you've already slaughtered your partners."
Episode 9,jorah mormont,You command the Unsullied. What do you think?
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,"Lo jention mirre nūmāzme ēza, iderenna qopsa verdagon issa."
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,You leave tonight.
Episode 9,jorah mormont,Very good. We'll prepare.
Episode 9,jorah mormont,"You're the Queensguard, Ser Barristan. Your place is by the Queen. If we are truly her loyal servants, we'll do whatever needs to be done. No matter the cost, no matter our pride."
Episode 9,arya stark,Don't! Don't kill him.
Episode 9,arya stark,"You're so dangerous, aren't you? Saying scary things to little girls. Killing little boys and old people. A real hard man you are."
Episode 9,arya stark,You're wrong. I know a killer. A real killer.
Episode 9,arya stark,You'd be like a kitten to him. He'd kill you with his little finger.
Episode 9,arya stark,No.
Episode 9,arya stark,Don't kill him! Please. Please don't.
Episode 9,jon snow,He breeds them for the Watch.
Episode 9,jon snow,The Watch protects him.
Episode 9,jon snow,We just take the horses and go. The old man's no threat.
Episode 9,jon snow,The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief. They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.
Episode 9,jon snow,Ygritte!
Episode 9,arya stark,No one's going to believe you're a hog farmer if you eat them all.
Episode 9,arya stark,I know they're still there.
Episode 9,arya stark,I'm not afraid.
Episode 9,arya stark,I knew fear when I saw it in you. You're afraid of fire.
Episode 9,arya stark,"When Beric's sword went up in flames, you looked like a scared little girl."
Episode 9,arya stark,"And I know why, too. I heard what your brother did to you. Pressed your face to the fire like you're a nice juicy mutton chop."
Episode 9,arya stark,Might do.
Episode 9,arya stark,Someday I'm gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull.
Episode 9,jon snow,You were right the whole time.
Episode 9,jorah mormont,There may be others.
Episode 9,jorah mormont,That's what you call a few guards?
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,"We've been waiting a long time. Haven't we? Well I don't know, you tell me. How long does it take to sack a city?"
Episode 9,jorah mormont,It was just as you said. They did not believe until it was too late. Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,And Daario Naharis?
Episode 9,catelyn stark,He complained about this marriage the entire ride from Riverrun and now look at him.
Episode 9,catelyn stark,Uncle.
Episode 9,catelyn stark,"Don't you drink, Lord Bolton?"
Episode 9,catelyn stark,I hope she makes you very happy.
Episode 9,robb stark,My mother's alone with Roose Bolton. I should rescue her.
Episode 9,robb stark,Be kind. She's finally starting to like you.
Episode 9,robb stark,Perhaps I've made a terrible mistake.
Episode 9,robb stark,Striking your king is an act of treason.
Episode 9,robb stark,"If you think the time is right, Lord Walder, by all means, let us bed them."
Episode 9,catelyn stark,Poor girl.
Episode 9,catelyn stark,"Oh, Ned forbade it. He said it wouldn't be right if he broke a man's jaw on our wedding night."
Episode 9,robb stark,I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigner's perspective.
Episode 9,robb stark,"It's tradition. Without the bedding ceremony, there's no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage."
Episode 9,robb stark,Boy or girl?
Episode 9,robb stark,"Oh, do you? It seems to me the father should have some say in his son's naming."
Episode 9,robb stark,I do.
Episode 9,catelyn stark,Robb!
Episode 9,catelyn stark,"Lord Walder! Lord Walder, enough! Let it end! Please! He is my son! My first son! Let him go and I swear that we will forget this! I swear it by the Old Gods and New! We will take no vengeance."
Episode 9,catelyn stark,"Take me for a hostage but let Robb go! Robb, get up! Get up and walk out! Please! Please!"
Episode 9,catelyn stark,"On my honor as a Tully, on my honor as a Stark, let him go or I will cut your wife's throat!"
Episode 9,robb stark,Mother.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Hmm. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall. Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
Episode 10,sansa stark,What are you doing?
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,I have a list.
Episode 10,sansa stark,A list of people you mean to kill?
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"For laughing at me? Do I look like Joffrey to you? No, death seems a bit extreme. Fear of death, on the other hand-"
Episode 10,sansa stark,You should learn to ignore them.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"My lady, people have been laughing at me far longer than they've been laughing at you. I'm the Halfman, the Demon Monkey, the Imp."
Episode 10,sansa stark,You're a Lannister. I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey. We're perfect for each other.
Episode 10,sansa stark,So how should we punish them?
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Who? Whom?
Episode 10,sansa stark,Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Ah. I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions. Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.
Episode 10,sansa stark,I hear that you're a pervert.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,I am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain.
Episode 10,sansa stark,"We could sheep shift Lord Desmondo s bed. You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside. Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again. His room will stink, but he won't know where it's coming from."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Lady Sansa!
Episode 10,sansa stark,My sister used to do that when she was angry with me. And she was always angry with me.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Why sheep shift?
Episode 10,sansa stark,That's the vulgar word for dung.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,My lady-
Episode 10,sansa stark,"Well, you asked me."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Killed a few puppies today?
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Roslin caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding. Signed Walder Frey.' Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something?
Episode 10,varys,"Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage."
Episode 10,cersei lannister,A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,No. She is no longer yours to torment.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I'm a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Let him make his threats. Hmm? He's a bitter little man.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,"Any man who must say, 'I am the king' is no true king. I'll make sure you understand that when I've won your war for you."
Episode 10,tywin lannister,The king is tired. See him to his chambers.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Come along.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,We have so much to celebrate. A wedding to plan. You must rest.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,"Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep."
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Come.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,Not you.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,You really think a crown gives you power?
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,No. I think armies give you power.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,Mm-hmm.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances."
Episode 10,tywin lannister,Which he got from me. Do you disapprove?
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,I'm all for cheating. This is war.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,But to slaughter them at a wedding. Explain to me why it is more noble to kill ten thousand men in battle than a dozen at dinner.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,So that's why you did it? To save lives?
Episode 10,tywin lannister,"To end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one. I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,The Northerners will never forget.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,Good. Let them remember what happens when they march on the south. All the Stark men are dead. Winterfell is a ruin. Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,I believe you still have some work to do on that score.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?
Episode 10,tywin lannister,"One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,I will not rape her.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,Does that amuse you?
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"No, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions."
Episode 10,tywin lannister,"Easy for me, is it?"
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?
Episode 10,tywin lannister,"The day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I brought you as my son. Because you're a Lannister."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Sansa.
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,Kill me.
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,Kill me!
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,Theon Greyjoy.
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,Th- Theon Greyjoy.
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,Please.
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,Reek. My name is Reek.
Episode 10,sam,Don't kill me!
Episode 10,sam,To Castle Black. I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.
Episode 10,sam,Who's your brother?
Episode 10,sam,You're Jon's brother. The one who fell from the window.
Episode 10,sam,I've been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one. And I've heard all about Hodor.
Episode 10,sam,"I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon. If you're his brother, you're my brother, too. And anything I can do to help you, I will."
Episode 10,sam,What? Why in the world would you want to go-
Episode 10,sam,Come with us. There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall. Hodor can carry you to the top. We'll walk straight to Castle Black.
Episode 10,sam,"If Jon is alive, then Castle Black's where he'll be. It's the safest place for you."
Episode 10,sam,"What I know is what I saw. And if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way."
Episode 10,sam,How do you know all that?
Episode 10,sam,But you're going to stop them?
Episode 10,sam,We found them at the Fist. Someone buried them a long time ago. Someone wanted us to find them.
Episode 10,sam,Killing White Walkers.
Episode 10,sam,"Well, I suppose someone had to be the first."
Episode 10,sam,"And the archer. I got lucky with one of them. There are more. Many more. And for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count. I wish you'd come with us."
Episode 10,davos,How are you keeping?
Episode 10,davos,It was just a bit of blood.
Episode 10,davos,I'm not a highborn.
Episode 10,davos,A recent state of affairs. I was born in Flea Bottom just like you.
Episode 10,davos,I lived below the Street of Flour.
Episode 10,davos,The shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door on Gin Alley.
Episode 10,davos,"The Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights? Pfft. You lived in the fancy part of town. And here we are now. Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king."
Episode 10,davos,"If you mistrust fancy people so much, why were you in such a hurry to trust her?"
Episode 10,davos,"She does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that."
Episode 10,davos,"Oh, that's a long story."
Episode 10,davos,Many years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation. He rewarded me with a lordship. And this.
Episode 10,davos,I didn't want to be a lord. I nearly didn't accept.
Episode 10,davos,I did it for my son. I didn't want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door. I wanted him to have a better life.
Episode 10,davos,He's dead.
Episode 10,davos,Following me.
Episode 10,varys,When did you come to this strange country?
Episode 10,varys,You were only a child.
Episode 10,varys,"You've been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know. He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father's money. Now it's just the drinking."
Episode 10,varys,She is a sweet young thing. None of this is her fault.
Episode 10,varys,"No, I expect not."
Episode 10,varys,"We break bread with them, but that doesn't make us family. We've learned their language, but we'll never be their countrymen. If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister-"
Episode 10,varys,You have one name. As do I. Here only the family name matters.
Episode 10,varys,"Diamonds. I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself. Get on one of those ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr. You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house. Hire servants. Start a new life, a good life, far from here. The mysterious foreign beauty. You'll have suitors lining up."
Episode 10,varys,"Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place. He has the mind for it, he has the will, he has the right last name. And you- you are a complication. I know you love him. And I know it's true love not bought by gold and silver. I'm not asking you to leave him for money. I'm asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him. This will never be your home, my lady. Find a true home somewhere far from here while there's still time."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Keep up.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,It's not easy being drunk all the time. Everyone would do it if it were easy.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Leave.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,"So, enjoying married life? An unhappy wife is a wine merchant's best friend."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,She doesn't deserve this.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Deserve? Be careful with that. Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long you'll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,There's nothing worse than a late-blooming philosopher.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?
Episode 10,cersei lannister,I won't be marrying Ser Loras.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,You're not me. You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?
Episode 10,cersei lannister,So she can have some happiness in her life.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,You have children. How happy would you say you are?
Episode 10,cersei lannister,"Not very. But if it weren't for my children, I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep. They're the reason I'm alive."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Even Joffrey?
Episode 10,cersei lannister,"Even Joffrey. He was all I had once. Before Myrcella was born. I used to spend hours looking at him. His wisps of hair. His tiny little hands and feet. He was such a jolly little fellow. You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies. 'We should have known. Even then we should have known.' It's nonsense. Whenever he was with me, he was happy. And no one can take that away from me, not even Joffrey- how it feels to have someone. Someone of your own."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,How long does it go on?
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Until we've dealt with all our enemies.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"Every time we deal with an enemy, we create two more."
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time.
Episode 10,arya stark,Mind if I keep warm?
Episode 10,arya stark,But I'm hungry.
Episode 10,arya stark,I've got money.
Episode 10,arya stark,It's worth a lot.
Episode 10,arya stark,Sorry.
Episode 10,arya stark,From you.
Episode 10,arya stark,The first man.
Episode 10,arya stark,Valar morghulis.
Episode 10,jon snow,"Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice. You always knew who I was, what I am."
Episode 10,jon snow,I have to go home now. I know you won't hurt me.
Episode 10,jon snow,I do know some things. I know I love you.
Episode 10,jon snow,I know you love me. But I have to go home now.
Episode 10,sam,I know how this must look. What I meant was-
Episode 10,sam,Maester.
Episode 10,sam,She hasn't chosen a name yet.
Episode 10,sam,"He's not my child, Maester Aemon. She's one of Craster's wives. I remember every word of the oath. Night gathers and my watch begins. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. The realms of men. That means her as well as us. We didn't build five hundred miles of ice walls seve hundred feet high to keep men out. The night is gathering, Maester Aemon. I've seen it. It's coming for all of us."
Episode 10,sam,Miles better.
Episode 10,davos,To His Grace King Stannis Baratheon. Invaded- inv- invit- invited to the name day celebration for Rylene Florent on the first nigit-
Episode 10,davos,First night of the full moon.' Why is there a G in night?
Episode 10,davos,"Well, your father's not going to go to that."
Episode 10,davos,I've been trying to stay out of those dungeons my whole life.
Episode 10,davos,"Aye, old Balerion's definitely better than anything your cousin Rylene's got on offer. But now that I'm your father's Hand again, I have to keep him informed. The king does not have time for this drudgery. 'To all the lords and knobble men of Westeros.'"
Episode 10,davos,"Noblemen of Westeros, the Nig- the Night's Watch implores-"
Episode 10,davos,Stay here. Bar the door.
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,The usurper Robb Stark is dead. Betrayed by his bannerman.
Episode 10,davos,And you take credit because you dropped a leech into the fire?
Episode 10,davos,"Your Grace, the world has got so far bent. I've seen things crawl out of nightmares, but my eyes were open. I don't know if Robb Stark died because of the Red Woman's sorcery or because at war men die all the time, but I do know that uniting the Seven Kingdoms with blood magic is wrong. It is evil. And you are not an evil man."
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,"Do you know who had this table carved and painted, Ser Davos?"
Episode 10,davos,Aegon Targaryen.
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,And do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?
Episode 10,davos,"On the back of his dragon, Balerion the Dread."
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,"He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced and a smaller army, but he had three dragons. Dragons are magic, Ser Davos. My enemies have made my kingdom bleed. I will not forget that. I will not forgive that. I will punish them with any arms at my disposal."
Episode 10,davos,"You do not need to burn the boy. If what you say is true, a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark-"
Episode 10,davos,His name is Gendry. He's a good lad. A poor lad from Flea Bottom who happens to be your nephew.
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,What is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom?
Episode 10,davos,Everything.
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,The boy must die.
Episode 10,davos,You're leaving.
Episode 10,davos,"Yes, but not on you."
Episode 10,davos,"Aim for that star. Don't stop. There's bread and water. Go slow with it. If you finish it off, no matter how thirsty you get, don't drink seawater."
Episode 10,davos,Row for a full day and night and you'll reach Rook's Rest. You'll want to stop there. Don't. She'll find you.
Episode 10,davos,You must keep the coast on your left side until you reach King's Landing.
Episode 10,davos,They were looking for me for twenty years. Do they know your face?
Episode 10,davos,I'd worry more about the Red Woman.
Episode 10,davos,The other way.
Episode 10,davos,You ever been in a boat before?
Episode 10,davos,Don't fall out. Go on.
Episode 10,davos,Because it's right. And because I'm a slow learner.
Episode 10,davos,"When you get to Flea Bottom, have a bowl of brown for me."
Episode 10,sam,"Jon! Jon! Jon, it's us."
Episode 10,jon snow,Pyp? Sam?
Episode 10,sam,"Hush, now. You're home. Carry him inside. Gently."
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Cersei.
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,You don't deny it?
Episode 10,davos,No. I let him go.
Episode 10,davos,"Aye, I do."
Episode 10,davos,There has got to be another way.
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,What other way?! Tell us about this other way.
Episode 10,davos,"I don't know, Your Grace. I can't see the future in the fire."
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,"Very well, Ser Davos Seaworth. I, Stannis of the House Baratheon, First of My Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, sentence you to die."
Episode 10,davos,"I understand. But since you haven't yet unnamed me Hand of the King, it is my duty to advise you against it. You're gonna need me."
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,Why am I gonna need you?
Episode 10,davos,"It's from Maester Aemon of the Night's Watch. Their Lord Commander is dead. Took a ranging party north and never made it back. One lad did, though. What he saw beyond the Wall- it's coming for all of us."
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,When did you learn to read?
Episode 10,davos,Matthos taught me before he died so I could be of better service to you.
Episode 10,davos,"You can't stop him alone. You need someone to rebuild your army for you, someone to convince this lord and that lord to fight for you, to bring sellswords and pirates to your side."
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,I've made my decision.
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,"You see, Ser Davos? You've been saved by that fire god you like to mock. You're in his army now."
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,Perhaps they didn't want to be conquered.
Episode 10,jorah mormont,You didn't conquer them. You liberated them.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,People learn to love their chains.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,No.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,"You do not owe me your freedom. I cannot give it to you. Your freedom is not mine to give. It belongs to you and you alone. If you want it back, you must take it for yourselves. Each and every one of you."
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,What does it mean?
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,It's all right. These people won't hurt me.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,Fly.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,Let me pass
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Magnificent.
Episode 1,tywin lannister,Mm-hmm.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Looks fresh-forged.
Episode 1,tywin lannister,It is.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,No one's made a Valyrian steel sword since the Doom of Valyria.
Episode 1,tywin lannister,There are three living smiths who know how to rework Valyrian steel. The finest of them was in Volantis. Came here to King's Landing at my invitation.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?
Episode 1,tywin lannister,From someone who no longer had need of it.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,You've wanted one of these in the family for a long time.
Episode 1,tywin lannister,And now we have two.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Two?
Episode 1,tywin lannister,The original weapon was absurdly large. Plenty of steel for two swords.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"Well, thank you. It's glorious."
Episode 1,tywin lannister,You'll have to train your left hand.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands.
Episode 1,tywin lannister,You'll never be as good.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"No. But as long as I'm better than everyone else, I suppose it doesn't matter."
Episode 1,tywin lannister,You can't serve in the Kingsguard with one hand.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Where's that written? I can and I will. The Kingsguard oath is for life.
Episode 1,tywin lannister,The war is over. The king is safe. The king is never safe.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike?
Episode 1,tywin lannister,Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner. They will continue to do so when you go home.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Home?
Episode 1,tywin lannister,You'll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,You are the Lord of Casterly Rock.
Episode 1,tywin lannister,I am the King's Hand. My place is here. I don't expect to see the Rock again before I die.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,You know what they call me? Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. Man without honor. Now you want me to break another sacred vow.
Episode 1,tywin lannister,You won't be breaking anything. There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties. The king will exercise that prerogative.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,No.
Episode 1,tywin lannister,No?
Episode 1,tywin lannister,I don't believe I asked you a question.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,There's my answer.
Episode 1,tywin lannister,If you think your bloody honor comes before...
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"My bloody honor is beyond repair, but my answer is still no. I don't want Casterly Rock. I don't want a wife. I don't want children."
Episode 1,tywin lannister,What do you want?
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Supper would be nice.
Episode 1,tywin lannister,"For 40 years I've tried to teach you. If you haven't learned by now, you never will. Go. If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition, go serve."
Episode 1,jaime lannister,I suppose you want the sword back.
Episode 1,tywin lannister,Keep it.
Episode 1,tywin lannister,A one-handed man with no family needs all the help he can get.
Episode 1,bronn,How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Please don't.
Episode 1,bronn,"Seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern. That way, one party is late, the other party can drink some ale inside."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends."
Episode 1,bronn,"If he's so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?"
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,There's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Has been for years.
Episode 1,bronn,"And just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood, it may as well be yours, eh?"
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,No need for cynicism. I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.
Episode 1,bronn,Oh.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Ah, here we are."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Can you read the sigils?
Episode 1,bronn,Yellow balls?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Boy knows his Dornish Houses.
Episode 1,bronn,I need a sigil.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?"
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Well met, my lords. His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name. My lord father, the King's Hand, sends his greetings as well. I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock, Master of Coin. Forgive me. I don't see Prince Doran in your company."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,And where is Prince Oberyn?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Very well. My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,You must be weary after such a long journey.
Episode 1,bronn,Some accomplished diplomacy that was. Now where?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies.
Episode 1,bronn,How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"You're famous for fucking half of Westeros. You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go?"
Episode 1,bronn,"I'd probably go to sleep, but I'm getting old."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion. We heard there might be..."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,trouble.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,I'm here to welcome you to the capital.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,If there's anything I can do to make your stay...
Episode 1,bronn,"It started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight."
Episode 1,bronn,"Killed the right people, I suppose."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I partook. Now I'm married."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Prince Oberyn, if I may, a word in private?"
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Oh, they take all kinds."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,The king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Well, speaking as a fellow second son, I have grown rather used to being the family insult."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?"
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,I thought we were speaking truth.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,I wasn't actually present.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,I've heard rumors.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,I wasn't there. I don't know what happened.
Episode 1,jorah mormont,"They're dragons, Khaleesi. They can never be tamed. Not even by their mother."
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Ser Barristan.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Where's Daario Naharis? Where's Grey Worm?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Gambling?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,How long have they been at it?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,What's the prize to winning this stupid contest?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,That honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan as neither of them kept me waiting this morning. You two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,The last man holding his sword can find a new queen to fight for.
Episode 1,sansa stark,"No, thank you."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"My lady, you do need to eat."
Episode 1,sansa stark,I don't need to eat.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,If I could have a moment alone with my wife.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,I can't let you starve.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,I swore to protect you.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"My lady, I am your husband. Let me help you."
Episode 1,sansa stark,How can you help me?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"I don't know, but I can try."
Episode 1,sansa stark,I lie awake all night staring at the canopy thinking about how they died.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep.
Episode 1,sansa stark,Do you know what they did to my brother? How they sewed his direwolf's head onto his body? And my mother. They say they cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"What happened to your family was a terrible crime. I didn't know your brother. He seemed like a good man, but I didn't know him. Your mother, on the other hand, I admired her. She wanted to have me executed, but I admired her. She was a strong woman. And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children. Sansa. Your mother would want you to carry on. You know it's true."
Episode 1,sansa stark,"Will you pardon me, my lord? I'd like to visit the godswood."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Of course. Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear."
Episode 1,sansa stark,I don't pray anymore. It's the only place I can go where people don't talk to me.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,What are you doing?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,How many times have I told you? You can't visit me here.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Of course I haven't forgotten.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Things are a bit tense right now.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,My nephew the king wants to murder me. My wife hates me because my father murdered her family. Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,I told you. It's not a good time.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Shae.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Love her? I barely know her. She's a child. She despises me.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Of course I don't love her.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Ship you away?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,What in the world are you talking about?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Shh. I don't know what you're talking about.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"You like it so much, you're welcome to chop off your own hand and take it."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Such an ingrate. I spent days with the goldsmith - getting the details just right.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Days?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"Better part of an afternoon. There, how does that feel?"
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Uh... a hook would be more practical.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"Elegant, I think."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Thank you for your help with the other matter.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"Gone completely. I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn."
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Odd little man.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"I've grown rather fond of him. He's quite talented, you know?"
Episode 1,jaime lannister,What symptoms?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Symptoms that are not your concern.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,You let him touch you?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,You jealous?
Episode 1,jaime lannister,I'm surprised. You never let Pycelle near you.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,You think I'd let that old lecher put his hands on me? He smells like a dead cat.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"Well, they smell like Pycelle."
Episode 1,jaime lannister,You drink more than you used to.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Yes.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Why?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"Let's see, you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital. My husband died in a tragic hunting accident."
Episode 1,jaime lannister,It must have been traumatic for you.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne. We suffered through a siege.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,A rather short siege.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"A rather short siege that I didn't expect to survive. And now I'm marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden while I'm supposed to marry her brother, a renowned pillow biter. So..."
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Father disowned me today.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,He can't disown you. You're all he's got.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,You're forgetting Tyrion.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"You don't really plan on staying in the Kingsguard, do you?"
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Not now.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,I want... Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Something's changed.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Everything's changed. You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same?
Episode 1,jaime lannister,What do you want me to apologize for?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,For leaving me.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Don't know what you wanted. You weren't here. You left me alone.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"Every day I was a prisoner, I plotted my escape. Every day. I murdered people so I could be here with you."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,You took too long.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,I... What are you saying?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,I'm saying you took too long.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Come in.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Go away.
Episode 1,jon snow,"Last time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell. ""He said, "" Next time I see you, you'll be all in black."" I was jealous of Robb my whole life. The way my father looked at him, I wanted that. He was better than me at everything... fighting and hunting and riding and girls. Gods, the girls loved him. I wanted to hate him, but I never could."
Episode 1,sam,Sometimes I want to hate you.
Episode 1,sam,"Well, you're better than me at everything. Except reading."
Episode 1,sam,They're... they're ready for you.
Episode 1,jon snow,He's wanted to hang me for a while. Now's his chance.
Episode 1,sam,No one's going to hang you. You've done nothing wrong.
Episode 1,jon snow,I've done plenty wrong.
Episode 1,jon snow,I didn't murder him.
Episode 1,jon snow,He wanted me to kill him.
Episode 1,jon snow,The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.
Episode 1,jon snow,"Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him..."
Episode 1,jon snow,"Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl."
Episode 1,jon snow,I do.
Episode 1,jon snow,"While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000."
Episode 1,jon snow,"100,000. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans. He has giants fighting for him."
Episode 1,jon snow,"Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?"
Episode 1,jon snow,And now you're here. You must not have been very good at your job.
Episode 1,jon snow,There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth.
Episode 1,jon snow,Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?
Episode 1,olenna tyrell,"No. No. You're a queen, not an ox."
Episode 1,olenna tyrell,Your grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my 51st nameday.
Episode 1,olenna tyrell,Nonsense.
Episode 1,olenna tyrell,"My little dears. Go and speak to the jewelers of King's Landing. Tell them who you are, tell them who sent you. The one who brings me the best necklace will get to keep the next best."
Episode 1,olenna tyrell,"The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the sept a fortnight from now will inspire 1,000 songs. Now, how sad it will be if she's wearing rubbish like that."
Episode 1,olenna tyrell,"You watch that. Even here, even with me."
Episode 1,olenna tyrell,My word.
Episode 1,brienne,My lady. My lady. Please pardon me for interrupting. My name is Brienne of Tarth.
Episode 1,olenna tyrell,We know who you are. We've heard all about you. But hearing is one thing. Aren't you just marvelous? Absolutely singular.
Episode 1,olenna tyrell,I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt like the silly little boy he is.
Episode 1,brienne,"My lady, I know this is a very busy time for you, but if I could just have a moment."
Episode 1,olenna tyrell,You dare not refuse.
Episode 1,brienne,"A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I swear to you by all the gods it was Stannis. He plunged his sword through Renly's heart and disappeared. One day, my lady, I will avenge our king."
Episode 1,brienne,I meant no offense.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"All the Kingsguard will be on duty, of course. Ser Boros will be stationed here. Ser Preston will be stationed here beside the primary entertainment. Your Grace?"
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Ser Meryn will guard Lady Margaery and Tommen.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"And I thank you for it, Ser Meryn. All very good. I don't expect any trouble."
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"Margaery Tyrell, I've heard."
Episode 1,jaime lannister,The war's not won. Not while Stannis lives.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"My apologies, Your Grace. I was rather busy."
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"So this is the famous ""Book of Brothers""? All the great deeds of all the great Kingsguard. Ser Arthur Dayne. The Sword of the Morning. Led the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood. Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat. Ser Duncan the Tall. Four pages for Ser Duncan. He must have been quite a man."
Episode 1,jaime lannister,So they say.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,There's still time.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"I use my left hand now, Your Grace. Makes for more of a contest."
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Have you ever been to Meereen?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,And?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates. You think the Great Masters are worried?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,You were told to ride at the back of the train.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,"All right, what is this matter of strategy?"
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Would you like to walk without shoes?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,"You are a gambler, aren't you?"
Episode 1,jorah mormont,There's one on every mile marker between here and Meereen.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,How many miles are there between here and Meereen?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,You will do no such thing. I will see each and every one of their faces. Remove her collar before you bury her.
Episode 1,brienne,There she is.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"Yes, there she is."
Episode 1,brienne,And? You made a promise.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,To return the Stark girls to their mother who is now dead.
Episode 1,brienne,To keep them safe.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"Well, Arya Stark hasn't been seen since her father was killed. Where do you think she is? My money's on dead. There's a certain safety in death, wouldn't you say? And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister. Bit of a complication."
Episode 1,brienne,A complication does not release you from a vow.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,What do you want me to do? Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her where? Where would she be safer than here?
Episode 1,brienne,Look me in the eye and tell me that you think she'll be safe in King's Landing.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"Are you sure we're not related? Ever since I've returned, every Lannister I've seen has been a miserable pain in my ass. Maybe you're a Lannister, too. You've got the hair for it if not the looks."
Episode 1,sansa stark,You're drunk.
Episode 1,sansa stark,Ser Dontos. The king's nameday celebration. I'm sorry. I should have remembered.
Episode 1,sansa stark,Anyone would have done the same.
Episode 1,sansa stark,"I can't take it. It's very, very kind of you, but I can't."
Episode 1,sansa stark,"I'll wear it with pride, Ser Dontos."
Episode 1,arya stark,When am I going to get a horse of my own?
Episode 1,arya stark,The little lady wants away from your stench.
Episode 1,arya stark,Why don't you have any money? Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey before you left?
Episode 1,arya stark,"You're not very smart, are you?"
Episode 1,arya stark,"You're fine with murdering little boys, but thieving is beneath you?"
Episode 1,arya stark,You think I'm gonna escape? Where would I go? I'd be dead by nightfall without you. My family's gone. I've got no one.
Episode 1,arya stark,I'm hungry. You're hungry.
Episode 1,arya stark,I know him. The small one. His name is Polliver. He captured us and took us to Harrenhal.
Episode 1,arya stark,He killed Lommy.
Episode 1,arya stark,He was my friend. Polliver stole my sword and put it right through his neck. He's still got it.
Episode 1,arya stark,My sword Needle.
Episode 1,arya stark,Lots of people name their swords.
Episode 1,arya stark,My brother gave me that sword.
Episode 1,arya stark,He killed my friend.
Episode 1,arya stark,"Something wrong with your leg, boy?"
Episode 1,arya stark,Can you walk? I've got to carry you?
Episode 1,arya stark,Fine little blade.
Episode 1,arya stark,Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,"A fine shot, master. My lady."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Your new hand, it's nicer than the old one. Wouldn't you agree, Pod?"
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Gilded steel.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,You're not eating. Why is no one eating? My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,I'm not hungry.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"You lost a hand, not a stomach. Try the boar. Cersei can't get enough of it since one killed Robert for her."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"A toast. To the proud Lannister children. The dwarf, the cripple, and the mother of madness."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Oh!
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"No, I'll do it. Leave us."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,It's only wine.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,I can't fight anymore.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,What about your left?
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"I can hold a sword, but all my instincts are wrong. How can I protect the king when I can hardly wipe my own ass?"
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,You're the Lord Commander now. Command. Let others do the fighting. When was the last time Father used a sword?
Episode 2,jaime lannister,I'm not Father. I'm the Kingslayer. When people find out I can't slay a pigeon...
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Train, then. Learn to fight with your other hand."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"With whom? You? Men talk. Soon as someone discovers I can't fight, he'll tell everyone."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"You need a proper, discreet swordsman. As it happens, I have just the one."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,My brother tells me you can keep your mouth shut. Unusual talent for a sellsword.
Episode 2,bronn,He tells me you shit gold just like your father.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Is this place safe?
Episode 2,bronn,"There's this knight, Leygood, got thunderbolts on his shield."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Uh-huh.
Episode 2,bronn,"Right here is where I fuck his wife. She's a screamer, that one. If they don't hear her, they won't hear us."
Episode 2,bronn,"I've never seen Valyrian steel before. She's a beauty. The problem is, if you fight with an edged blade, I'll have to."
Episode 2,bronn,"And if I fight with an edged blade, I'll have no one left to pay me."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,I haven't used a sparring sword since I was nine.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"Ah! Bold warrior you are, attacking a man when his guardo s down."
Episode 2,bronn,Best time to attack a man.
Episode 2,bronn,Mind yourself. JAIME; If I still had my right hand...
Episode 2,bronn,Plan on growing it back?
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"Come on, then."
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,"I'm sorry, my lord."
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,"I don't know, my lord."
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,"No, my lord. Just two farm boys."
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,"Yes, my lord."
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,Jon Snow is at Castle Black.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the king?
Episode 2,varys,I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome at such exclusive affairs.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Oh, to be foreign."
Episode 2,varys,Ahem.
Episode 2,varys,Shae has been noticed. Sansa's maid saw you with her. She already told your sister. It's only a matter of time before your father hears.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden. My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie.
Episode 2,varys,"No, I will not. How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying? I have no pet sellsword to protect me. No legendary brother to avenge me. Only little birds who whisper in my ear."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Forgive me if I don't weep for you.
Episode 2,varys,No one weeps for spiders or whores. I have friends across the sea who could help her.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"She won't leave. I've told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it."
Episode 2,varys,Your father has promised to hang the next whore he finds you with. Have you ever known your father to make an idle threat?
Episode 2,cersei lannister,She's the whore I told you about. The dark-haired one.
Episode 2,tywin lannister,Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand before the wedding.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"The Lives of Four Kings."" Grand Maester Kaeth's history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good. A book every king should read."
Episode 2,tywin lannister,"One of only two Valyrian steel swords in the capital, Your Grace, freshly forged in your honor."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Don't.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Don't call me that.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I'm afraid our friendship can't continue.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,There's a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"You'll have your own cabin, of course, and, across the Narrow Sea, a house, servants."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"I'm a married man. My wife has suffered a great deal, as you well know. I don't want her to suffer anymore on my account. I need to uphold my vows."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I need to do right by her.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,By our children.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I'm not afraid.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I need you to leave.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Shae.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,You're a whore! Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are not. I can't be in love with a whore. I can't have children with a whore. How many men have you been with? Five hundred? Five thousand?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all. But now that time is over.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,You'll have a comfortable life in Pentos. Bronn will escort you to your ship.
Episode 2,davos,Lord Florent was your brother by law.
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,He was an infidel.
Episode 2,davos,"He worshipped the gods of his fathers and their fathers before him. They were the gods of your fathers, too."
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,I ordered him to tear down his idols. He disobeyed.
Episode 2,davos,How many ships did he bring to your 'cause? How many men?
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,A good deal more than you.
Episode 2,davos,"I'm sure they're more than grateful, my queen."
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,Meat's off.
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,"Serve fish, then. We're on an island."
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,"I hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same."
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,Of course I remember.
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,She's a child.
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,She's my daughter. You will not strike her.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,He saw us.
Episode 2,sansa stark,We have a new queen.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Better her than you.
Episode 2,tywin lannister,"Bit much, wouldn't you say?"
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,It feels proportionate.
Episode 2,tywin lannister,Proportionate to what?
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,The expected extravagance.
Episode 2,tywin lannister,People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long.
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,You ought to try enjoying something before you die. You might find it suits you.
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,"Not now, Mace. Lord Tywin and I are speaking."
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,"Anyway, I don't know what you're complaining about. I'm paying my share."
Episode 2,tywin lannister,Shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity?
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,"No, your heartfelt thank you is its own reward. I would imagine I'd be hearing it again before long. Wars are rather expensive. ""The Iron Bank will have it's due."" How they love to remind everyone. Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts."
Episode 2,tywin lannister,I'm not worried about the Iron Bank.
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,"We both know you're smarter than that. Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love."
Episode 2,bronn,All taken care of.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,You saw her board the ship?
Episode 2,bronn,"Aye, she's on it."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,You saw the ship sail away?
Episode 2,bronn,"No one knows she's there but you, me, and Varys."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,How do you know?
Episode 2,bronn,"Because if someone follows me without an invitation, I'm the last person they ever follow."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,There's someone following you?
Episode 2,bronn,"She's gone. I know you don't want to believe it, but she is. Now, go drink till it feels like you did the right thing."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Hello.
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,"You look exquisite, child. The wind has been at you, though. I haven't had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother. War is war, but killing a man at a wedding, horrid. What sort of monster would do such a thing? As if men need more reasons to fear marriage."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,My lady. My lady.
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,"Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that. Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit. Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it. You must excuse me. It's time I ate some of this food I paid for."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,You're an example to us all.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"Ser Loras, it's quite all right. Your sister looks very beautiful."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"So, looking forward to your wedding?"
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"Perhaps they should get married. If you were to marry Cersei, she'd murder you in your sleep. If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, she'd murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath. Luckily for you, none of this will happen because you'll never marry her."
Episode 2,brienne,Your Grace. My king. My queen.
Episode 2,brienne,"I'm no lady, Your Grace."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Did you just bow?
Episode 2,brienne,"Apologies, Your Grace. I never did master the curtsy."
Episode 2,brienne,I just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune. The country has been at war too long. I hope your reign is long and peaceful.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Lady Brienne. You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter. That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not.
Episode 2,brienne,"As you say, Your Grace."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,I owe you my gratitude. You returned my brother safely to King's Landing.
Episode 2,brienne,"In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace. More than once."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Did he? Haven't heard that story before.
Episode 2,brienne,"Not such a fascinating story, I'm afraid."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,I'm sure you have many fascinating stories. Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother. Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.
Episode 2,brienne,"I don't serve your brother, Your Grace."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,But you love him.
Episode 2,brienne,Your Grace.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,She'll do no such thing.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,You should see Qyburn. He's quite good.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?
Episode 2,cersei lannister,My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him. What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me?
Episode 2,cersei lannister,But you are. You annoy me right now. Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me. So here's what I want you to do. I want you to leave my presence. Leave this wedding right now. Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,The queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will.
Episode 2,tywin lannister,You're in rather a good mood.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,I suppose I am.
Episode 2,tywin lannister,I won't ask why.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Small pleasures.
Episode 2,tywin lannister,Prince Oberyn.
Episode 2,tywin lannister,Charmed.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,No? How tolerant of you.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn. It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding."
Episode 2,tywin lannister,"Please give him our regards. With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again."
Episode 2,tywin lannister,Noblemen in my part of the country don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,We'll have to find another way to thank the king.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace. I would like to keep what remains of my face. I think you should fight him. This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. This one is clearly mad with lust. It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,A fine vintage. Shame that it spilled.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Your Grace does me a great honor.
Episode 2,sansa stark,Can we leave now?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Let's find out.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Your Grace?
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,Help the poor boy.
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,"Idiots, help your king."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Move away!
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Joffrey! Joffrey!
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Help him! Someone help him!
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Joffrey!
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Joffrey! Joffrey!
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Don't touch him!
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"Joffrey. Please, Joffrey. Joffrey, what is it? Help him!"
Episode 2,cersei lannister,My son.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"He did this. He poisoned my son, your king. Take him. Take him! Take him! Take him!"
Episode 3,cersei lannister,You did this. You did this!
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Take him! Take him!
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Where is his wife? Where's Sansa?
Episode 3,tywin lannister,Find her. Bar the gates of the city. Seize every ship in the harbor.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Where is she?!
Episode 3,tywin lannister,No one leaves the capital! No one!
Episode 3,sansa stark,Where are we going?
Episode 3,sansa stark,Lord Baelish?
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"Petyr... Are you hurt, my lady?"
Episode 3,petyr baelish,Good. Good. I'm sure you've had quite a fright. Rest easy. The worst is past. Ser Dontos shouts up from his boat.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"Softly, my friend... Voices carry over water."
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"Shh. You don't want the queen to hear, do you? 1,000 gold cloaks are searching for you. And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?"
Episode 3,sansa stark,I didn't murder anyone.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"I know. I know. But you must admit it looks suspicious. The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder."
Episode 3,sansa stark,Why did you kill him?
Episode 3,petyr baelish,Because he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools.
Episode 3,sansa stark,He saved me.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders. Every one of them. And he did it all for gold. Money buys a man's silence for a time. A bolt in the heart buys it forever."
Episode 3,sansa stark,He was helping me because I saved his life.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother. The last legacy of House Hollard."
Episode 3,petyr baelish,I had it made a few weeks ago. What did I once tell you about the capital?
Episode 3,sansa stark,We're all liars here.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"Come, my lady. I know you've had a difficult day. But you're safe now. I promise you that. You're safe with me and sailing home."
Episode 3,olenna tyrell,"More than you were with Renly. Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying. In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue."
Episode 3,olenna tyrell,"The world is overflowing with horrible things. But they're all a tray of cakes next to death. They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know? Made me look at it."
Episode 3,olenna tyrell,They took me to the Great Hall and there he was. The man I'd married and suffered to father my children. A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings. There he was... lying on a table.
Episode 3,olenna tyrell,"Nonsense. Your circumstances have improved markedly. You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that."
Episode 3,olenna tyrell,Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us. You did wonderful work on Joffrey. The next one should be easier.
Episode 3,tywin lannister,Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means?
Episode 3,tywin lannister,I'm not trying to trick you.
Episode 3,tywin lannister,"Yes, you will become king. What kind of king do you think you'll be?"
Episode 3,tywin lannister,"Mm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?"
Episode 3,cersei lannister,This is hardly the place or the time.
Episode 3,tywin lannister,Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.
Episode 3,tywin lannister,Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?
Episode 3,tywin lannister,No.
Episode 3,tywin lannister,"Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?"
Episode 3,tywin lannister,Yes!
Episode 3,tywin lannister,Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?
Episode 3,tywin lannister,"No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?"
Episode 3,tywin lannister,"Yes, but why? To further the family line. Do you know how that happens?"
Episode 3,tywin lannister,"Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?"
Episode 3,jaime lannister,How are you?
Episode 3,jaime lannister,You are. You will be. I'll see to that.
Episode 3,jaime lannister,Please give the queen a moment alone with her son.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"It was Tyrion. He killed him. He told me he would. ""A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth."" That's what he said to me. You saw it. You saw Joff point at him just before he..."
Episode 3,jaime lannister,I don't know what I saw.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Avenge him. Avenge our son. Kill Tyrion.
Episode 3,jaime lannister,Tyrion's my brother. Our brother. There'll be a trial. We'll get to the truth of what happened.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"I don't want a trial. He'll squirm his way to freedom given the chance. I want him dead. Please, Jaime. You have to. He was our son. Our baby boy."
Episode 3,jaime lannister,You're a hateful woman. Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman?
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"Jaime, not here, please. Please."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Stop it. Stop it. Stop.
Episode 3,jaime lannister,No.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Stop it. Stop.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Stop. Stop. It's not right.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,It's not right. It's not right.
Episode 3,jaime lannister,I don't care.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Don't.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"Don't. Jaime, don't."
Episode 3,arya stark,Gonna rain soon. Where are we?
Episode 3,arya stark,You think? You don't have a map?
Episode 3,arya stark,Maybe we should get one.
Episode 3,arya stark,How far is it to the Eyrie?
Episode 3,arya stark,And you're sure we're going the right way?
Episode 3,arya stark,On your way where?
Episode 3,arya stark,I'd like to see Braavos one day.
Episode 3,arya stark,I have friends there.
Episode 3,arya stark,We were just watering the horses. We'll be on our way. Forgive my father. He was wounded fighting in the war. Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it.
Episode 3,arya stark,He's never been the same.
Episode 3,arya stark,The Tullys of Riverrun.
Episode 3,arya stark,Father!
Episode 3,arya stark,I'm so sorry.
Episode 3,arya stark,Really good.
Episode 3,arya stark,What did you do?!
Episode 3,arya stark,You told me you weren't a thief.
Episode 3,arya stark,He took us in. He fed us and you...
Episode 3,arya stark,You don't know that.
Episode 3,arya stark,You're the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms.
Episode 3,sam,She's not a whore.
Episode 3,sam,They all think I'm lying.
Episode 3,sam,Killing the white Walker.
Episode 3,sam,But you're the only one that saw it. And they all think you're just a...
Episode 3,sam,"Well, a wildling."
Episode 3,sam,"It's not a very nice word, I suppose."
Episode 3,sam,So... are you all right? No one bothering you?
Episode 3,sam,I worry about it sometimes. All the time.
Episode 3,sam,"100 men, one woman."
Episode 3,sam,That's the only thing they think about.
Episode 3,sam,I'm not being silly. There's 100 men lying awake at night picturing you.
Episode 3,sam,What about me? Gilly? I worry about you.
Episode 3,sam,For what?
Episode 3,sam,"I don't know if you're safe here. They're my brothers, but some of them were thieves before they came here. Some of them were rapers. You saw what they did at your father's keep."
Episode 3,sam,Maybe you'd be safer in Mole's Town.
Episode 3,sam,Bored of you? I... I want to protect you.
Episode 3,davos,Your Grace.
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,You're a literary man now. What do you make of that?
Episode 3,davos,Joffrey?
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,The usurper Joffrey Baratheon. I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire. A leech filled with bastard blood. A bastard you set free. I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it.
Episode 3,davos,"I will find you an army, Your Grace. I've been working day and night..."
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,What progress have you made?
Episode 3,davos,I've rallied House Peasebury to your 'cause.
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,House Peasebury.
Episode 3,davos,House Musgood.
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,House Musgood.
Episode 3,davos,And House Haigh.
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,House Haigh. They don't have enough men between them to raid a pantry.
Episode 3,davos,"Westeros is not the world, Your Grace. We need to look east for ships and men. 10,000 skilled soldiers fight for the Golden Company."
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,The Golden Company?
Episode 3,davos,They've never broken a contract.
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,They're sellswords.
Episode 3,davos,"We're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but we're not willing to pay men to fight? Now the Red Woman's magic is real. Her visions and prophecies may be, too, but I've never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war. Soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground. It's dirty on the ground."
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,We don't have any gold.
Episode 3,davos,Not yet.
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,"If I do not press my claim, my claim will be forgotten. I will not become a page in someone else's history book. I'm running out of time, Ser Davos. Which means you're running out of time. -"
Episode 3,davos,"I'm sorry, Princess."
Episode 3,davos,The Hand of the King doesn't have much leisure time.
Episode 3,davos,"That happened once, weeks ago. You're your father's daughter, no mistake. Bloody relentless, the both of you."
Episode 3,davos,The Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas. First Sword of Braavos.
Episode 3,davos,Thank you very much.
Episode 3,davos,"No, I was never a pirate. I was a smuggler."
Episode 3,davos,"Well, if you're a famous smuggler, you're not doing it right."
Episode 3,davos,Your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior. So do the Braavosi.
Episode 3,davos,"Of course. Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos. I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers, but he didn't seem any more interested in the distinction than your father. I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom, you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction..."
Episode 3,davos,I need you to write a message.
Episode 3,davos,It's too important for me. I need a smart person to do it. Go on.
Episode 3,davos,To the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos from Stannis Baratheon the one true king of Westeros.
Episode 3,davos,I need to get their attention. Go on. Write.
Episode 3,sam,"He's seen some adventures, hasn't he?"
Episode 3,sam,That's right. She'll clean and cook and look after the other girls' babies.
Episode 3,sam,No other work.
Episode 3,sam,I promise to come back and visit whenever I can. You'll be safer here. Who's gonna protect you at Castle Black? Me?
Episode 3,sam,"This is different. They're brothers of the Night's Watch and I can't just stab them in the back and I can't run away, which is what we did at Craster's."
Episode 3,sam,You have to trust me. It's for the best.
Episode 3,sam,"Oh, Gilly. Please don't."
Episode 3,tywin lannister,Prince Oberyn.
Episode 3,tywin lannister,May we have the room?
Episode 3,tywin lannister,"No, thank you."
Episode 3,tywin lannister,Are you?
Episode 3,tywin lannister,Which way is that?
Episode 3,tywin lannister,Some believe the king choked.
Episode 3,tywin lannister,I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel.
Episode 3,tywin lannister,"Your hatred for my family is rather well known. You arrive at the capital, an expert in poisoning, some days later my grandson dies of poisoning."
Episode 3,tywin lannister,You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived. What did you discuss?
Episode 3,tywin lannister,What did you discuss?
Episode 3,tywin lannister,For which you blame me.
Episode 3,tywin lannister,"Here I stand unarmed, unguarded. Should I be concerned?"
Episode 3,tywin lannister,Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors' knowledge.
Episode 3,tywin lannister,Categorically.
Episode 3,tywin lannister,I'm sure he would enjoy speaking with you.
Episode 3,tywin lannister,I could arrange for this meeting.
Episode 3,tywin lannister,"There will be a trial for my son. And as custom dictates, three judges will render a verdict. I will preside. Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge. I would like you to be the third."
Episode 3,tywin lannister,"Not long ago, the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon. Declared themselves enemies of the throne. Now they are our strongest allies."
Episode 3,tywin lannister,I will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new king's principal advisors.
Episode 3,tywin lannister,"We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold. The king is dead. The Greyjoys are in open rebellion. A wildling army marches on the Wall. And in the East, a Targaryen girl has three dragons. Before long, she will turn her eyes to Westeros. Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons."
Episode 3,tywin lannister,We need each other. You help me serve justice to the king's assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elia's.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Podrick. Apologies for the stench.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,A noble effort.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,You're a good lad. Any word of Shae?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,I suppose that's a good thing. What are they saying about me out there?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Do you believe I murdered Joffrey?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"No. Gods, no. The world is a better place without him, but I had nothing to do with it. I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination, I'd plan it in such a way that I wouldn't be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died. Trial in a fortnight. Have they announced the judges yet?"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Of course.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Gone?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"No one had more 'cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,They'll be following you now.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"I don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Varys could vouch for me if he dared.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Why not?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Are you going to accept their offer?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Pod, the trial's in a fortnight. They'll want an answer before that."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"I will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late. Pod! This is farewell."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Pod. There has never lived a more loyal squire.
Episode 3,jon snow,"Mance Rayder is coming. If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them."
Episode 3,jon snow,Help him.
Episode 3,jon snow,And the mutineers stayed?
Episode 3,jon snow,We need to ride north and kill them all.
Episode 3,jon snow,"It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them."
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Are they attacking?
Episode 3,jorah mormont,A single rider. A champion of Meereen. They want you to send your own champion against him.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,What is he doing?
Episode 3,jorah mormont,They're not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"I have something to say to the people of Meereen. First, I will need this one to be quiet. Do I have a champion?"
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,You are the commander of the Unsullied. I cannot risk you.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Which is why you must remain by my side.
Episode 3,jorah mormont,"I've been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi. Let me stand for you today as well."
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"You are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend. I will not gamble with your life."
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Very well. You have quite an audience. Make it worth their while.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, win or lose, as long as the whole city is watching."
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,You sure you don't want a horse?
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Horses are faster than men.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,I am Daenerys Stormborn.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"Your Masters may have told you lies about me, or they may have told you nothing. It does not matter. I have nothing to say to them. Only to you. First I went to Astapor. Those who were slaves in Astapor now stand behind me, free. Next I went to Yunkai. Those who were slaves in Yunkai now stand behind me, free. Now I have come to Meereen. I am not your enemy. Your enemy is beside you."
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Your enemy steals and murders your children. Your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands. I do not bring commands. I bring you a choice. And I bring your enemies what they deserve. Forward!
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Fire!
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,How are the lessons coming?
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,You'll have to continue later. It's time.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"Remind me, Ser Jorah, how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts?"
Episode 4,jorah mormont,"163, Khaleesi."
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, that was it."
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,I will answer injustice with justice.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,What the hell was that?
Episode 4,bronn,That was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"You're a rare talent. When you're fighting cripples, anyway."
Episode 4,bronn,You learned to fight like a good little boy. I'll bet that thrust through the MadKing's back was pretty as a picture. You want to fight pretty or you want to win?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,You talk to my brother this way?
Episode 4,bronn,All the time. He got used to it.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Do you think he did it?
Episode 4,bronn,"No. Oh, he hated the little twat, sure. But who didn't? And poison's not his style. Or murder, for that matter. You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?"
Episode 4,bronn,"You haven't been to see him yet, eh?"
Episode 4,jaime lannister,We're done for today.
Episode 4,bronn,Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.
Episode 4,bronn,Aye. But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day. You were his first choice. He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him. You gonna fight for him now?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"To tell you the truth, this isn't so bad. Four walls. A pot to piss in. I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,Is that supposed to make me feel better?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Maybe a bit. I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"It's complicated, yes. So how is our sister?"
Episode 4,jaime lannister,How do you think? Her son died in her arms.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,Her son?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Don't. You know what's coming?
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"My trial for regicide.Yes, I know. I know the whole bloody country thinks I'm guilty. I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count. And that judge is my father. As for Cersei, well, she's probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed."
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"Now that you mention it, she did ask."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"So, should I turn around and close my eyes?"
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Depends. Did you do it?
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,The Kingslayer brothers. You like it? I like it. You're really asking if I killed your son?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Are you really asking if I'd kill my brother? How can I help you?
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Well, you could set me free."
Episode 4,jaime lannister,You know I can't.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,Then there's really nothing else to say.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,What do you want me to do? Kill the guards? Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart? I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Sorry, I'd forgotten. I'd hate for you to do something inappropriate."
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Inappropriate? You're accused of killing the king.Freeing you is treason.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,Except I didn't do it.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"Which is why we're having a trial. A trial. If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne, confessed to his crimes, and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt, it wouldn't matter to Cersei. She won't rest until my heado s on a spike."
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Not just yours. She's offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,Sansa couldn't have done this. She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms. Do you think it's a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died?
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"No, but... Sansa's not a killer. Not yet, anyway."
Episode 4,sansa stark,Where are you taking me?
Episode 4,petyr baelish,I'm getting married to your Aunt Lysa. She's waiting for us at the Eyrie. You'll be safe there.
Episode 4,sansa stark,Did you kill Joffrey?
Episode 4,petyr baelish,Did I kill Joffrey? I've been in the Vale for weeks.
Episode 4,sansa stark,I know it was you.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,And who helped me with this conspiracy?
Episode 4,sansa stark,"Well, there was Ser Dontos. You used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king."
Episode 4,petyr baelish,Why not?
Episode 4,sansa stark,Because you're too smart to trust a drunk.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,Then perhaps it was your husband.
Episode 4,sansa stark,No.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,How do you know?
Episode 4,sansa stark,I just do.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,You're right. He wasn't involvedi n Joffrey's death. But you were. Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you? I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.
Episode 4,sansa stark,"The poison. I don't understand. The Lannisters gave you wealth, power. Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal."
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next."
Episode 4,sansa stark,"I don't believe you. If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's. You'd risk that just to confuse them?"
Episode 4,petyr baelish,So many men they risk so little. They spend their lives avoiding danger. And then they die. I'd risk everything to get what I want.
Episode 4,sansa stark,And what do you want?
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"Everything. My friendship with the Lannisters was productive. But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally. And who could trust a friend like that?"
Episode 4,sansa stark,Who could trust you?
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"I don't want friends like me. My new friends are predictable. Very reasonable people. As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly. Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong."
Episode 4,olenna tyrell,"The time has come, my dear. There's nothing more tedious than a trial. Except perhaps these gardens. If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs."
Episode 4,olenna tyrell,Have you been to see Tommen yet?
Episode 4,olenna tyrell,"I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know. He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola. I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the momentI saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do. So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber."
Episode 4,olenna tyrell,How absentminded of me.
Episode 4,olenna tyrell,"The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk."
Episode 4,olenna tyrell,"And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before. I was good. I was very, very good. You are even better. But you need to act quickly. Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid. She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can. And by the time you're married, it'll be too late. Luckily for you ,the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy. Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit."
Episode 4,olenna tyrell,"He could have done,but he didn't."
Episode 4,olenna tyrell,"But I do know. You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?"
Episode 4,olenna tyrell,Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that. You just do what needs to be done.
Episode 4,jon snow,Bring it through! And again.
Episode 4,jon snow,Very nice. Good.
Episode 4,jon snow,A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.
Episode 4,jon snow,Let's see what you can do.
Episode 4,jon snow,"Olly, you just watch for now."
Episode 4,jon snow,Have you ever held a sword before? OLLY I was the best archer in our hamlet.
Episode 4,jon snow,"You two. Take it slow, try and disarm each other."
Episode 4,jon snow,You know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him.
Episode 4,jon snow,Grenn and I were helping them.
Episode 4,jon snow,Someone has to train them.
Episode 4,jon snow,My father was highborn. My mother wasn't.
Episode 4,jon snow,Jon Snow.
Episode 4,jon snow,You fight well.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"You sent for me, Your Grace?"
Episode 4,cersei lannister,Your Grace. How formal of you. How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommen's door?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Ser Boros is on duty tonight. Tomorrow I believe...
Episode 4,cersei lannister,So one? You have one man guarding the future king?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,I promise you Tommen's safe. We're protecting him.
Episode 4,cersei lannister,The way you protected Joffrey? Why did Catelyn Stark set you free?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,What?
Episode 4,cersei lannister,I've been wondering for months. Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital. Why did she set you free?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,You know why. She'd hoped I'd send her daughters back to her.
Episode 4,cersei lannister,She hoped or did you promise?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive, I'd return them to her."
Episode 4,cersei lannister,So you made a sacred vow to the enemy.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,I wanted to get back to you. Should I have told hert o fuck off?
Episode 4,cersei lannister,"You didn't mean it, then? You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark?"
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"Catelyn Stark's dead. So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa, if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head, would you do it?"
Episode 4,cersei lannister,I know you went to see Tyrion. That creature who murdered our son.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,I had to see him. I had to know for myself.
Episode 4,cersei lannister,And?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"He didn't do it, Cersei."
Episode 4,cersei lannister,"You've always pitied him. Our poor little brother. Abused by the world. Despised by his father and sister. He'd kill us all if he could. I want four men at Tommen's door day and night. That will be all, Lord Commander."
Episode 4,brienne,"Ser Jaime Lannister. Knighted and named to the Kingsguard in his 16th year. At the sack of King's Landing, murdered his king Aerys II. Pardoned by Robert Baratheon. Thereafter known as the Kingslayer."
Episode 4,jaime lannister,It's the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages. And there's still room left on mine.
Episode 4,brienne,Valyrian steel.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Mmm. It's yours.
Episode 4,brienne,I can't accept this.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword. You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter. You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother. Lady Stark's dead. Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe. I've got something else for you."
Episode 4,jaime lannister,I hope I got your measurements right.
Episode 4,brienne,I'll find her. For Lady Catelyn. And for you.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,I almost forgot. I have one more gift.
Episode 4,brienne,I don't need a squire.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Of course you do.
Episode 4,brienne,He'll slow me down.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,My brother owes him a debt. He's not safe here. You're keeping him from harm. It's chivalry.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,See? He's a good lad.You'll get along.
Episode 4,bronn,Compliments of Lord Tyrion. His axe from the Blackwater.
Episode 4,bronn,"What are you waiting for, a kiss? Ready the lady's horse."
Episode 4,jaime lannister,They say the best swords have names. Any ideas?
Episode 4,brienne,Oathkeeper.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"Good-bye, Brienne."
Episode 4,sam,I should neverhave taken her away.
Episode 4,jon snow,She wasn't safe here.
Episode 4,sam,"She's not safe out there. I should have known. You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall. If they're raiding the smaller villages, Mole's Town could be next."
Episode 4,jon snow,Castle Black could be next.
Episode 4,sam,I should go back for Gilly.
Episode 4,jon snow,We have orders. No one's to leave the castle.
Episode 4,sam,I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb.
Episode 4,jon snow,"And I remember who came after me and brought me home. I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me. When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him."
Episode 4,sam,"I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me. I tried. Really, I did."
Episode 4,jon snow,How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?
Episode 4,sam,I don't know. They'd pass wildling villages. They could try to find shelter at one of them.
Episode 4,jon snow,The wildlings have joined up with Mance. Every village or sheltered place will be deserted. Except...
Episode 4,sam,Craster's? You think Bra nmight have found...
Episode 4,jon snow,"Thank you, Ser Alliser."
Episode 4,jon snow,"Ahem, brothers."
Episode 4,jon snow,"I'm going beyond the Wallto Craster's Keep. I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them. I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me?"
Episode 4,jon snow,I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall.
Episode 4,jon snow,"Thank you, brothers."
Episode 5,varys,Your Grace.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,There he is.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Long may he reign.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?"
Episode 5,cersei lannister,You still mourn for Joffrey?
Episode 5,cersei lannister,He would have been your nightmare.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"You knew exactly what he was. I did, too. You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child. Doesn't matter what they do. And what he did, it shocked me. Do you think I'm easily shocked?"
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"The things he did shocked me. He's only a boy. A good boy. A decent boy. He always has been. Who was the last decent king, I wonder? He could be the first man who sits on that throne in fifty years to actually deserve it."
Episode 5,cersei lannister,He will need help... if he's going to rule well.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"A mother is not enough. You're still interested in being queen, I take it?"
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"Yes, speak to your father. I'll speak to mine."
Episode 5,jorah mormont,King Joffrey Baratheon is dead. Murdered at his own wedding.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,Who told you to take the Navy?
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,So why did you do it?
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,How many ships?
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,How many men can they carry?
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,Would that be enough to take King's Landing?
Episode 5,jorah mormont,The Lannisters have more.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,It's hard to say. It could be enough. But we're not fighting to make you Queen of King's Landing. Ten thousand men can't conquer Westeros.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,"The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win, as they always have."
Episode 5,jorah mormont,"There's other news. From Yunkai. Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule, the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city. They've re-enslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you. And in Astapor, the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon who's declared himself ""His Imperial Majesty."""
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"Please leave me. Not you, Jorah."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind. A boy sits on the Iron Throne. A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it. They've never been more vulnerable.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth. I didn't listen. That all worked out well.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me?
Episode 5,jorah mormont,You're a Targaryen. You're the Mother of Dragons.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,I need to be more than that. I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains. I will not sail for Westeros.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,"What, then?"
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,I will do what queens do. I will rule.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,Pull up your hood. A memorable shade.
Episode 5,sansa stark,But how would they know?
Episode 5,petyr baelish,You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most? Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.
Episode 5,sansa stark,Is this the only way into the Eyrie?
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"The mountains are impassable. If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate. It doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats. The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them. And the fortress they built here has never been overcome. Not once in a thousand years. Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth ten thousand."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece, Alayne."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,My lord.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,Oh. I have brought you a gift.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,My lady.
Episode 5,sansa stark,"It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn. My name is Al..."
Episode 5,sansa stark,"It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa."
Episode 5,sansa stark,Of course. I understand.
Episode 5,sansa stark,I would never say a thing.
Episode 5,sansa stark,"They did, and my father's."
Episode 5,sansa stark,Make him fly?
Episode 5,sansa stark,They did. They made us both. Lord Tyrion didn't want to.
Episode 5,sansa stark,No. We never...
Episode 5,sansa stark,"It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,Go. We'll speak soon.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I, extricating Sansa, getting her here alive."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,Ought we not... inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?
Episode 5,petyr baelish,I do think that we could wait until...
Episode 5,petyr baelish,Like it was yesterday.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,The deed is done. Faded into nothing. Only speaking of it can make it real.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"Tonight it is, then."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"Let me bathe and dress for the occasion. Once I'm presentable, I'll call on the septon immediately."
Episode 5,tywin lannister,When will the wedding take place in your mind?
Episode 5,cersei lannister,As soon as decency permits. After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.
Episode 5,tywin lannister,A fortnight?
Episode 5,cersei lannister,That seems reasonable.
Episode 5,tywin lannister,"No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no seventy-seven-course meals."
Episode 5,tywin lannister,And your wedding to Loras?
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Shortly after Tommen's.
Episode 5,tywin lannister,Shortly?
Episode 5,cersei lannister,A fortnight.
Episode 5,tywin lannister,I know you don't like them. I didn't like your husband. Used to pat me on the back a lot. I didn't trust him.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,We had that in common.
Episode 5,tywin lannister,You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Then whom can we trust?
Episode 5,tywin lannister,Ourselves alone.
Episode 5,tywin lannister,The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Robert wasn't particularly rich.
Episode 5,tywin lannister,Robert had me funding him. Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.
Episode 5,tywin lannister,Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Haven't a clue.
Episode 5,tywin lannister,"Go on, your best guess."
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"Pounds, tons, ounces?"
Episode 5,tywin lannister,Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,That can't be.
Episode 5,tywin lannister,Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Then how do we pay for anything?
Episode 5,tywin lannister,The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,How much?
Episode 5,tywin lannister,A tremendous amount.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement."
Episode 5,tywin lannister,The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank. There is no someone.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Someone does work there. It is comprised of people.
Episode 5,tywin lannister,"And a temple is comprised of stones. One stone crumbles and another takes its place. And the temple holds its form for a thousand years or more. That's what the Iron Bank is... a temple. We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it. You can't run from them. You can't cheat them. You can't sway them with excuses. If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back. Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect."
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"It's for the good of the family, I understand that. I'm not sure my brothers do."
Episode 5,tywin lannister,"I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion. And as a mother, that is your right. But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you."
Episode 5,cersei lannister,I respect that. We don't need to discuss it.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters. You've started wars to protect this family. Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future. What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?
Episode 5,arya stark,Joffrey. Cersei. Walder Frey. Meryn Trant. Tywin Lannister. The Red Woman. Beric Dondarrion. Thoros of Myr. Ilyn Payne. The Mountain.
Episode 5,arya stark,I can't sleep until I say the names.
Episode 5,arya stark,Only the ones I'm going to kill.
Episode 5,arya stark,"If he were here right now, what would you do?"
Episode 5,arya stark,I'm almost done. Only one name left.
Episode 5,arya stark,The Hound.
Episode 5,sansa stark,Thank you.
Episode 5,sansa stark,Really?
Episode 5,sansa stark,"My mother, fat? She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food."
Episode 5,sansa stark,They're delicious. Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.
Episode 5,sansa stark,Yes. I'm very lucky.
Episode 5,sansa stark,"Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful."
Episode 5,sansa stark,"Well, I'm half Tully. He loved your family so much."
Episode 5,sansa stark,No.
Episode 5,sansa stark,"He loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you."
Episode 5,sansa stark,"No, never."
Episode 5,sansa stark,"What? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never-"
Episode 5,sansa stark,"Aunt Lysa, no, I-"
Episode 5,sansa stark,Nothing. I'm a virgin.
Episode 5,sansa stark,You're hurting me.
Episode 5,sansa stark,"I'm a virgin, I swear it. He loves you, Aunt Lysa. All he says is that I'm stupid. I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and I'm a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth. And I swear to you that he has never touched me. Not once, not ever."
Episode 5,brienne,Didn't they teach you how to ride a horse?
Episode 5,brienne,"Perhaps you should have stayed with him. It's not going to be a pleasant journey for you. It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather."
Episode 5,brienne,"Well, Lady Sansa's brother's at Castle Black. If I were her, that's where I'd go. Feel free to stop at any point."
Episode 5,brienne,I've made it this far in the world without a squire. I don't see why I need one now.
Episode 5,brienne,"I'm not a knight. And I'm not a slaver, either. I don't own you."
Episode 5,brienne,I am releasing you from that oath. That means you could leave.
Episode 5,brienne,What do you think will happen if you leave?
Episode 5,arya stark,Practicing.
Episode 5,arya stark,No one's going to kill me.
Episode 5,arya stark,It's not fighting. It's water dancing.
Episode 5,arya stark,"The greatest swordsman who ever lived. Syrio Forel, the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos."
Episode 5,arya stark,What do you know about anything?
Episode 5,arya stark,It was not.
Episode 5,arya stark,Yes.
Episode 5,arya stark,He was killed.
Episode 5,arya stark,Meryn Trant. That's why Ser Meryn-
Episode 5,arya stark,He was outnumbered.
Episode 5,arya stark,Syrio didn't have a sword. Or armor. Just a stick.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Prince Oberyn. Writing letters?
Episode 5,cersei lannister,May I show you the gardens?
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"No, you couldn't."
Episode 5,cersei lannister,I didn't realize you were a poet.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,For your paramour?
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"You have several, don't you?"
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Eight? Eight daughters?
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Beautiful name.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"Perhaps that's why she's difficult. The gods love their stupid jokes, don't they?"
Episode 5,cersei lannister,You're a prince of Dorne. A legendary fighter. A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros. But you could not save your sister. I'm a Lannister. Queen for nineteen years. Daughter of the most powerful man alive. But I could not save my son. What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love?
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"Yes, we can avenge them."
Episode 5,cersei lannister,I know he did.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"We'll have a trial, anyway. I haven't seen my daughter in over a year."
Episode 5,cersei lannister,I want to believe that. I want to believe she's happy.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"Everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls. Would you bring her a gift for me? I wasn't there for her name day. I don't know when I'll see her again."
Episode 5,cersei lannister,The best shipwrights in King's Landing have been working on it for months. Myrcella loves the open water.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Please tell her... her mother misses her very much.
Episode 5,brienne,Did you remove the skin?
Episode 5,brienne,Have you ever cooked a rabbit before?
Episode 5,brienne,Did you ever cook anything for Lord Tyrion?
Episode 5,brienne,What are you doing?
Episode 5,brienne,"I've been removing my own armor for quite some time, thank you very much."
Episode 5,brienne,What exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion?
Episode 5,brienne,"Oh. Whilst in Lord Tyrion's service, did you ever do anything remotely related to combat?"
Episode 5,brienne,Who?
Episode 5,brienne,How did you kill a Kingsguard?
Episode 5,brienne,Bloody ridiculous. Help me with these straps.
Episode 5,jon snow,How many?
Episode 5,jon snow,Why?
Episode 5,jon snow,Get some rest. We move at sundown.
Episode 5,bronn,Jon! Jon!
Episode 5,jon snow,Are you all right? Come with me. Come on.
Episode 5,jon snow,We lost four brothers?
Episode 5,jon snow,I count ten dead mutineers.
Episode 5,jon snow,Where in seven hells? Come here.
Episode 5,jon snow,"I missed you, boy."
Episode 5,jon snow,It's not safe for you here on your own. Mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there's worse out there than Mance. Come with us to Castle Black. We can find you work. Keep you safe.
Episode 5,jon snow,You want to stay here in Craster's Keep?
Episode 6,davos,"Your Grace, if you'd like to sit, I'm sure that--"
Episode 6,stannis baratheon,We've been here since midday.
Episode 6,davos,"Easterners have a difference sense of time, I've often found. Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos. Together, we were going to run three shiploads of the finest--"
Episode 6,davos,"This is Stannis of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
Episode 6,stannis baratheon,He shares no blood with me. He is a bastard born of incest. As was his brother before him.
Episode 6,stannis baratheon,It's not a story. It's the truth.
Episode 6,stannis baratheon,Gold you loaned him.
Episode 6,stannis baratheon,More than any man living.
Episode 6,stannis baratheon,"4,000."
Episode 6,davos,32.
Episode 6,stannis baratheon,None.
Episode 6,davos,My lord.
Episode 6,davos,"Well, strictly speaking, I didn't do the thieving. That would be the pirates. I just moved what they stole from one place to another. {DAVOS removes his right glove to show the stubs of his fingers."
Episode 6,davos,"This is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes. I consider it an honest accounting. He's an honest man and he's your best chance to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros. Which is a lot, I imagine. Wars are expensive."
Episode 6,davos,"As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over. Who's the real power in King's Landing?"
Episode 6,davos,Humor me.
Episode 6,davos,How old is Tywin Lannister?
Episode 6,stannis baratheon,"67. And when he dies, who's in command? A half-grown boy, the product of incest? Cersei Lannister, a queen whose people despise her? Jaime Lannister, a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect? When Tywin's gone, who do you back?"
Episode 6,davos,"Begging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now. There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros. Stannis. He's got the birthright. He's in his prime. He's a tried and tested battle commander. And he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it."
Episode 6,davos,You think they ever met a pirate who didn't tell them that joke?
Episode 6,davos,Only half rotted.
Episode 6,davos,"No time, I'm afraid. We sail at sunrise."
Episode 6,davos,"You, me-- we."
Episode 6,davos,You won't be alone. And you won't be poor.
Episode 6,davos,There's a chest of the good stuff left back at your house. I gave it to your wife.
Episode 6,davos,I'll see you at sunrise.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,No!
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,You can't trick me. Tell him. Tell him you couldn't trick me.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,Not Theon! Reek! Reek! My name is Reek!
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"No, you can't! You can't!"
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"No, I don't believe her! I know who I am! I'm Reek! Reek! Loyal Reek! Good Reek! I've always been Reek!"
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,I'm Reek! Loyal Reek!
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,Reward?
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,I-- I didn't want them to take me. I was so scared. I didn't want them--
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"Yes, of course, my lord."
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,But how can--
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,Pretend to be who?
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,"You stand before Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Sea, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons. Don't be afraid, my friend."
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,I thank him for his prayers.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,"Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship. I cannot bring back his goats,"
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,but I will see he is paid their value three times over.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,Send the next one in.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq can speak to me himself.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,I thank you.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,Then it is my honor to receive you.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,"For that, he has my gratitude. I should be honored to meet him."
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,Your father crucified innocent children.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,"I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime. You'd be wise to remember that."
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,And what traditions do you speak of?
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified? They were rotting in the sun as well. Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial?
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,"Bury your father, Hizdahr zo Loraq."
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,How many more?
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,212?
Episode 6,tywin lannister,The trial begins this afternoon. We only have the morning for affairs of state. Shall we begin?
Episode 6,varys,"Sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, my lord."
Episode 6,cersei lannister,A coward and a traitor.
Episode 6,varys,"My birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers. I believe the phrase ""fuck the king"" was uttered."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,What would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?
Episode 6,varys,10 silver stags seems a generous bounty.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Make it 100. What else?
Episode 6,varys,"More whispers from the east, my lord."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,The Targaryen girl?
Episode 6,varys,Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen. She has conquered the city and rules as its queen.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,Conquered with what?
Episode 6,varys,"She commands an army of Unsullied, my queen. Some 8,000 strong. She has a company of sellswords-- the Second Sons. She has two knights advising her-- Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy. And she has three dragons."
Episode 6,cersei lannister,"Baby dragons. Larger every year, Your Grace."
Episode 6,varys,"No longer. He appears to be fully devoted to her. As for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated."
Episode 6,cersei lannister,He's an old man. He wasn't fit to protect my son.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Joffrey didn't die on his watch. Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,Don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world.
Episode 6,varys,"A child with two seasoned warriors counseling her and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years. Armies win them all the time. She must be dealt with.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"Eventually, if it comes to that. Can your little birds find their way into Meereen?"
Episode 6,varys,"Most certainly, my Lord Hand."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"Mmm. Lord Tyrell, be a good man. Fetch my quill and paper."
Episode 6,varys,Prince Oberyn.
Episode 6,varys,Only Varys. I'm not actually a nobleman. No one is under obligation to call me lord.
Episode 6,varys,You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied. Did you spend much time in Essos?
Episode 6,varys,May I ask why?
Episode 6,varys,Most of us aren't princes.
Episode 6,varys,I have an ear for accents. I've lost my accent entirely.
Episode 6,varys,It's a long story.
Episode 6,varys,People I trust.
Episode 6,varys,"Not at all. But I was never interested in girls, either."
Episode 6,varys,Nothing.
Episode 6,varys,"Not me. When I see what desire does to people, what it's done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it. Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Let me guess, I've been pardoned."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Really?
Episode 6,jaime lannister,Father's orders.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Well, we mustn't disappoint Father."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"Tyrion of the House Lannister, you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide. Did you kill King Joffrey?"
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,No.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?"
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Not that I know of.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"How would you say he died, then?"
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Choked on his pigeon pie.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,So you would blame the bakers?
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,The crown may call its first witness.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing?"
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Silence.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"Silence! You will not speak unless called upon. You're dismissed, Ser Meryn."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,By whom?
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"Grand Maester, you examined King Joffrey's corpse. Was it without question poison that killed him?"
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?
Episode 6,cersei lannister,I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,"Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay. I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines. As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements. He believed his presence would inspire the troops."
Episode 6,cersei lannister,I discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand. I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs. He wasn't pleased.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"Thank you, Your Grace, for the courage of your testimony."
Episode 6,varys,"I'm afraid I do, my lord. He said, ""Perhaps you should speak more softly to me, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."""
Episode 6,varys,Yes. After we received word of Robb Stark's death. He didn't seem gladdened by the news. Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"You're excused, Lord Varys."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Father, may I ask the witness one question?"
Episode 6,tywin lannister,One.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat. You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget. Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?"
Episode 6,varys,"Sadly, my lord, I never forget a thing."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,We will adjourn for now.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Toll the bells in an hour's time.
Episode 6,jaime lannister,You'd condemn your own son to death?
Episode 6,tywin lannister,I've condemned no one. The trial is not over.
Episode 6,jaime lannister,This isn't a trial. It's a farce. Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,I know nothing of the sort.
Episode 6,jaime lannister,You've always hated Tyrion.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,He killed his king.
Episode 6,jaime lannister,As did I. Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me? To bring him your head. I saved your life so you could murder my brother?
Episode 6,tywin lannister,It won't be murder. It'll be justice.
Episode 6,jaime lannister,Justice?
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"I'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King. If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly."
Episode 6,jaime lannister,He'll be executed.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"No, he'll be punished accordingly."
Episode 6,jaime lannister,"Once you said family is what lives on. All that lives on. You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years. What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,I'm well aware of your oath.
Episode 6,jaime lannister,What happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I don't even remember?
Episode 6,tywin lannister,What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson's killer?
Episode 6,jaime lannister,It survives through me. I'll leave the Kingsguard. I'll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Done.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,"When the testimony's concluded and a guilty verdict rendered, Tyrion will be given the chance to speak. He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch. In three days' time, he'll depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall. You'll remove your white cloak immediately. You will leave King's Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock. You will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister. And you'll never turn your back on your family again."
Episode 6,jaime lannister,You have my word.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,And you have mine.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Not going well, is it?"
Episode 6,jaime lannister,You're going to be found guilty.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Oh, you think so?"
Episode 6,jaime lannister,"When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall. Father's agreed to it. He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.
Episode 6,jaime lannister,Father is not Joffrey. He'll keep his word.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,How do you know?
Episode 6,jaime lannister,Do you trust me?
Episode 6,jaime lannister,Keep your mouth shut. No more outbursts. This will all be over soon.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,The crown may call its next witness.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,State your name.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest?
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Do you know this man?
Episode 6,tywin lannister,How do you know him?
Episode 6,tywin lannister,This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey. What do you know of this?
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Silence! Continue.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,How did you come to be in his service?
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Silence. Silence!
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Shae. Please don't.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Father, I wish to confess. I wish... to confess."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,You wish to confess?
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Tyrion. Do you wish to confess?
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Yes, Father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?"
Episode 6,tywin lannister,You admit you poisoned the king?
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"No, of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,You are not on trial for being a dwarf.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Oh, yes, I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life."
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Have you nothing to say in your defense?
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Nothing but this-- I did not do it. I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.
Episode 6,tywin lannister,Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn. Escort the prisoner back to his cell.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"I'm sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?"
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"You threw your life away. You threw it away. It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?"
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"Of course it's a joke, just not a very funny one. I couldn't- I couldn't listen to her standing there telling her lies. I couldn't do it."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,You fell in love with a whore.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Careful. I'm the last friend you've got.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,At least I got to tell them what they really are.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"Yes, brilliant speech. They'll be talking about it for days to come. I thought you were a realist. Didn't realize you'd die for pride."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"Don't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,I can't save you this time either. My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,It is tempting.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"Well... Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again. If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,If he wins.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,No. Not Ser Meryn.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Ser Gregor. Welcome to the capital. Thank you for riding here so quickly.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,You seem to be in good form.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Does it matter?
Episode 7,arya stark,Could be soldiers.
Episode 7,arya stark,You shouldn't be sitting out here like this.
Episode 7,arya stark,So why go on?
Episode 7,arya stark,Nothing could be worse than this.
Episode 7,arya stark,Nothing isn't better or worse than anything. Nothing is just nothing.
Episode 7,arya stark,My name is Arya. Arya Stark.
Episode 7,arya stark,You were Yoren's prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall. He told me he'd fuck me bloody with a stick.
Episode 7,arya stark,He can't be. I don't know his name.
Episode 7,arya stark,Thank you.
Episode 7,jon snow,Greetings.
Episode 7,sam,"All right, Jon?"
Episode 7,jon snow,"Come on, Ghost."
Episode 7,jon snow,Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.
Episode 7,jon snow,We need to prepare.
Episode 7,jon snow,We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.
Episode 7,jon snow,We wouldn't.
Episode 7,jon snow,"Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have."
Episode 7,jon snow,They won't stop them.
Episode 7,jon snow,The stewards.
Episode 7,jon snow,No.
Episode 7,jon snow,The builders.
Episode 7,bronn,My lord.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,You have new clothes.
Episode 7,bronn,Do you like 'em? Eh? Gloves are doeskin. Softer than a virgin's thighs.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,I sent for you days ago.
Episode 7,bronn,I've been a bit busy.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,Doing what?
Episode 7,bronn,My lonesome bachelor days are over. I'm to wed Lollys Stokeworth.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,Lollys Stokeworth? She doesn't strike me as your sort of girl.
Episode 7,bronn,I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,She's dim-witted.
Episode 7,bronn,"If I wanted wits, I'd marry you."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"When my sister arranged this love match, did she mention that Lollys has an older sister?"
Episode 7,bronn,"Falyse. Aye, I did know about the older sister."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,And you understand the rules of inheritance?
Episode 7,bronn,Falyse is forty and barren.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.
Episode 7,bronn,She does. Unless she happens to perish before her father. Then Lollys gets the castle.
Episode 7,bronn,What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,You and my sister deserve each other. Why did you bother to come here?
Episode 7,bronn,"You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out, you'd double their price."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,Is it two wives you want or two castles?
Episode 7,bronn,"One of each will do. But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.
Episode 7,bronn,I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.
Episode 7,bronn,"Your sister's a Lannister, too."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it."
Episode 7,bronn,"If and may and could. It's bloody cold up north. Lollys is soft and warm. And close. If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,Does he frighten you so much?
Episode 7,bronn,"I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?"
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,Because you're my friend.
Episode 7,bronn,"Aye, I'm your friend. And when have you ever risked your life for me?"
Episode 7,bronn,"I like you, pampered little shit that you are. I just like myself more."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,I understand.
Episode 7,bronn,I'm sorry it has to be this way.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,Why are you sorry? Because you're an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart? That's what I liked about you in the first place.
Episode 7,bronn,We had some good days together.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"Yes, we did."
Episode 7,bronn,What will you do?
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,I suppose I'll have to kill the Mountain myself. Won't that make for a great song?
Episode 7,bronn,I hope to hear them sing it one day.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"How did you get in here? Your door is well guarded,"
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Don't do that again.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"These are my private quarters. If I want you here, I will summon you."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Tell me why you're here.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"And as for women, there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,You swore me your sword.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Very well.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Do what you do best.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Take off your clothes.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,Khaleesi.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,You're here early.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,Later than some.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,You don't approve?
Episode 7,jorah mormont,"It's not a question of approval, it's a question of trust."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,You neither approve nor trust.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,Why would I? The man's a sellsword.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?
Episode 7,jorah mormont,I did.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,I trust you.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands. How could you ever have faith in a man like that?
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,I could never have faith in a man like Daario. That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,You have?
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,I have.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,"Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai. The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms. They mutilate little boys by the thousands. They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men. They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself."
Episode 7,jorah mormont,"Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts. The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known. If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?
Episode 7,jorah mormont,"It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Let the priests argue over good and evil. Slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it. And I will end those behind it.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,"I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,And now you are helping me show them to freedom.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,Hizdahr zo Loraq?
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai. He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen. He will explain the choice they have before them. They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves. Tell him I changed my mind."
Episode 7,jorah mormont,"Yes, Khaleesi."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,No. Tell him you changed my mind.
Episode 7,arya stark,"You're doing it wrong. You need to burn away that horrible bit there. Otherwise it's gonna get infected and fester. I know you don't like fire, but if you don't do it right-"
Episode 7,arya stark,It'll only take a second. It won't hurt that much.
Episode 7,arya stark,Why?
Episode 7,arya stark,Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.
Episode 7,brienne,Bit of comfort never hurt anyone. We've been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks. I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you.
Episode 7,brienne,Just don't start expecting silk underclothes. Not working for your former lord any longer.
Episode 7,brienne,Don't get drunk.
Episode 7,brienne,"No, this will do nicely, thank you. Kidney pie is wonderful."
Episode 7,brienne,No.
Episode 7,brienne,We're looking for someone.
Episode 7,brienne,"A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty. Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name."
Episode 7,brienne,I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark. I swore to her I'd bring her daughters home.
Episode 7,brienne,What?
Episode 7,brienne,You wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.
Episode 7,brienne,You're not interesting enough to be offensive.
Episode 7,brienne,What about? Not kidney pie.
Episode 7,brienne,No one's seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded. She's presumed dead.
Episode 7,brienne,When was that?
Episode 7,brienne,So what happened to her?
Episode 7,brienne,The quick version.
Episode 7,brienne,"Um, you were saying?"
Episode 7,brienne,"Her mother's dead, grandfather's dead, Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun. The Brotherhood isn't going to Riverrun."
Episode 7,brienne,Why the Eyrie?
Episode 7,brienne,"Sansa could be there, too."
Episode 7,brienne,You sure about this?
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"Mm, do tell. I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,Oh.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,I think I would have remembered that.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,You and my family have more in common than you might admit.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,That would have made things so much easier.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place."
Episode 7,sansa stark,"Hello, Robin."
Episode 7,sansa stark,"I'm building my home, Winterfell. At least I think I am. I haven't been back there in a very long time."
Episode 7,sansa stark,It's a long story.
Episode 7,sansa stark,"Yes, you certainly are."
Episode 7,sansa stark,Probably never. My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.
Episode 7,sansa stark,"No, I'm afraid not. It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground."
Episode 7,sansa stark,We don't.
Episode 7,sansa stark,I never did anything with them at all. Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.
Episode 7,sansa stark,I like the sound of that.
Episode 7,sansa stark,All right.
Episode 7,sansa stark,Careful. You've ruined it. Now I'm going to have to rebuild the whole thing.
Episode 7,sansa stark,You did.
Episode 7,sansa stark,Knocking things down isn't fixing them. It's ruining them.
Episode 7,sansa stark,You're being stupid.
Episode 7,sansa stark,"Robin, I'm sorry, I-"
Episode 7,petyr baelish,Children.
Episode 7,sansa stark,I hit him.
Episode 7,petyr baelish,"Yes, I saw."
Episode 7,sansa stark,I shouldn't have done that.
Episode 7,petyr baelish,"No, his mother should have a long time ago. Consider it a step in the right direction."
Episode 7,sansa stark,If he tells Aunt Lysa...
Episode 7,petyr baelish,Let me worry about Aunt Lysa.
Episode 7,sansa stark,I was trying to remember what everything looked like. I'll never see it again.
Episode 7,petyr baelish,"A lot can happen between now and never. If you want to build a better home, first you must demolish the old one."
Episode 7,sansa stark,Why did you really kill Joffrey? Tell me why.
Episode 7,petyr baelish,"I loved your mother more than you could ever know. Given the opportunity, what do we do to those who've hurt the ones we love? In a better world, one where love could overcome strength and duty, you might have been my child. But we don't live in that world."
Episode 7,petyr baelish,You're more beautiful than she ever was.
Episode 7,sansa stark,Lord Baelish...
Episode 7,petyr baelish,Call me Petyr.
Episode 7,sansa stark,"You wanted to see me, Aunt Lysa?"
Episode 7,sansa stark,No.
Episode 7,sansa stark,"I'm so sorry, Aunt Lysa. I never should have hit Robin, I know it. I promise it won't happen-"
Episode 7,sansa stark,I didn't. You don't understand.
Episode 7,sansa stark,He kissed me. I pulled away.
Episode 7,sansa stark,Please!
Episode 7,petyr baelish,Lysa! Let her go.
Episode 7,petyr baelish,Let her go.
Episode 7,petyr baelish,"I'll send her away. I swear on my life. I swear to all the gods. Let her go, Lysa."
Episode 7,petyr baelish,"Oh, my sweet wife. My sweet, silly wife."
Episode 7,petyr baelish,"I have only loved one woman... only one, my entire life. Your sister."
Episode 8,sam,I should never have left her there.
Episode 8,jon snow,You couldn't have known.
Episode 8,sam,Of course I couldo ve known. They were raiding the villages close by.
Episode 8,sam,She's dead because of me.
Episode 8,jon snow,"We can't go after them, you know that. That's what they want."
Episode 8,sam,Little Same. As if I'd cut their throats myself.
Episode 8,sam,She might have.
Episode 8,jon snow,"If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next. Mance's army must be close."
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,You think he was spying on you?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body. They make love under the stars for the whole Khalasar to see.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,But you are not Dothraki.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,"Well, I don't see why it matters. Grey worm isn't interested, none of the unsullied care what's under our clothes."
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,What?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,"When the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it?"
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,The...the pillar an the stones.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Haven't you ever wondered?
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,"I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands."
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,I'm Reek.
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,Always. Forever.
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,Yes.
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,I was born on Pike to Balon Greyjoy. His third and last-living son. I am your prince. I swear it by the drowned god. What is dead may never die.
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell. He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow Ironborn.
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,You are fading from sickness. You are badly outnumbered and you're hundreds of miles from the sea. Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold. Do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me. The Boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore.
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,"My own father, your king, surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon. I watched him bend the knee. There was no shame there. He fought with honor, as did you."
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear..."
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,scared* You don't know.
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,whispering* Reek. Reek.
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,Reek.
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,Yes. Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates. You're going home.
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,Yes m'lord. Will we go home now?
Episode 8,sansa stark,He can stay.
Episode 8,sansa stark,"to Petyr* I'm sorry, Lord Baelish. I have to tell the truth. *to the council* I'll tell you everything."
Episode 8,sansa stark,"My name is not Alayne. It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark. Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell. You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall."
Episode 8,sansa stark,"Lord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing...except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale. He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name."
Episode 8,sansa stark,"You knew her well, my lords, my lady. You knew she was a troubled woman. She always loved Lord Baelish. She told me herself. From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack. She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn. She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have. When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy. For a time. My aunt was a jealous lady. She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore. That he would abandon her for a younger woman. And then...one day she saw him kiss me."
Episode 8,sansa stark,"It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more. Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage. He's always been so kind to me. I was so happy to be here, to be free. All because of him. But my aunt turned on me. She cursed me. Called me a whore. Promised to throw me through the Moon Door. When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him. She said she didn't want to live anymore. She stood on the edge of that Moon Door. He tried to reason with her. Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was...*begins sobbing*"
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Why did the usurper pardon you?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,"No, speak to me here. Explain it to me."
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,"Why, then?"
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,What was the content of these letters?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,What information?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Yes or no?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Don't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Because you knew it was poisoned.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,You betrayed me from the first.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother's throne...
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,and you want me to forgive you?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,"Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed. But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive. Go back to your masters in King's Landing. Collect your pardon if you can."
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,"Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name. You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city. If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay. Go. Now."
Episode 8,sansa stark,Yes?
Episode 8,sansa stark,They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.
Episode 8,sansa stark,"If they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me?"
Episode 8,sansa stark,Neither do I.
Episode 8,sansa stark,I know what you want.
Episode 8,arya stark,Lots of things make me happy.
Episode 8,arya stark,"Killing Polliver, killing Rorge."
Episode 8,arya stark,At least I could have been there to watch. I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.
Episode 8,arya stark,You protected him for most of his life. You think you could have saved him?
Episode 8,arya stark,That's your stupid pride talking. It's why you'll never be a great killer. I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.
Episode 8,arya stark,You should have let me burn it.
Episode 8,arya stark,That fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to.
Episode 8,arya stark,You really think my aunt will pay for me?
Episode 8,arya stark,I've never even met her.
Episode 8,arya stark,I'm not a lady.
Episode 8,sansa stark,Shall we go?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?
Episode 8,jaime lannister,Soon.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?"
Episode 8,jaime lannister,I've never seen him fight.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die."
Episode 8,jaime lannister,Oberyn believes in himself.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?
Episode 8,jaime lannister,Beheading.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word."
Episode 8,jaime lannister,Cousins.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?"
Episode 8,jaime lannister,Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Nothing made him happier.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,"The joke wore thin, though."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,For you. You drifted away.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,I had other interests.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson."
Episode 8,jaime lannister,Why?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. ""Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?"" He gave me an answer. ""Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!"" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library."
Episode 8,jaime lannister,Volarik. Tried to touch me once.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of ""khuu, khuu, khuu"". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard ""khuu, khuu, khuu"" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason."
Episode 8,jaime lannister,"Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?"
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once."
Episode 8,jaime lannister,He was twice your size.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"He just pushed me aside with a ""khuu"" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?"
Episode 8,jaime lannister,I don't know.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,Good luck today.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Looks like very light armor.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,It could get you killed. It could get me killed.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Thank the gods.
Episode 8,tywin lannister,"standing up* The gods have made their will known. Tyrion Lannister, in the name of King Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, you are hereby sentenced to death."
Episode 9,sam,What was she like?
Episode 9,jon snow,She...she had red hair.
Episode 9,sam,Oh? How big were her feet?
Episode 9,jon snow,Well what do you want me to say?
Episode 9,sam,I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone. To be with someone. To love someone and have them love you back. We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned. You're the closest I'll ever get to know it.
Episode 9,jon snow,So you and Gilly never-
Episode 9,sam,No...she just had a baby! ...and she never offered.
Episode 9,jon snow,"But if she had, you wouldo ve? You'd have broken your vows?"
Episode 9,sam,"The interesting thing is, our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women."
Episode 9,jon snow,What?
Episode 9,sam,"I shall take no wife"" yes, that's in there, there's no denying that. ""I shall father no children"" it's very specific. But what our vows have to say about other...activities...is open to interpretation."
Episode 9,jon snow,I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.
Episode 9,sam,"Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret. We didn't. So what's it like?"
Episode 9,jon snow,"It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet!"
Episode 9,sam,"No, you're really not."
Episode 9,jon snow,And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.
Episode 9,sam,There'll be arrows for all of us soon I imagine.
Episode 9,jon snow,There will.
Episode 9,sam,They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.
Episode 9,jon snow,"Go get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch."
Episode 9,sam,Maester Aemon. How did you know-
Episode 9,sam,Let me help you.
Episode 9,sam,Maester Faull
Episode 9,sam,But what he says about what they do...it's all true. It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.
Episode 9,sam,I don't love her.
Episode 9,sam,No.
Episode 9,sam,You were?
Episode 9,sam,"I'm sorry Maester, I didn't mean it like that."
Episode 9,sam,Who was she?
Episode 9,sam,Pyp! Open the gate.
Episode 9,sam,Yes!
Episode 9,sam,"Oh, Pyp. Open the fucking gate!"
Episode 9,sam,"Yes, well, best get used to it."
Episode 9,sam,"Are you alright? Shh, you're alright. Yeah, of course you are my brave little fella."
Episode 9,sam,I'm so so sorry. I didn't know until I got back.
Episode 9,sam,Never.
Episode 9,sam,"Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me. From now on, wherever you go, I go too."
Episode 9,jon snow,"There we go, boys. That's one. There's two. Come on, let's get the next lot. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser."
Episode 9,jon snow,Yes sir.
Episode 9,jon snow,"It was a difficult decision either way, Ser."
Episode 9,sam,You'll be safe down here. I'll check on you as soon as I can.
Episode 9,sam,I'm not leaving you!
Episode 9,sam,I...I didn't mean in the same room.
Episode 9,sam,Help my brothers.
Episode 9,sam,I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.
Episode 9,sam,"Look. I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly. I made a promise to defend The Wall and I have to keep it, because that's what men do."
Episode 9,sam,I promise you I won't die.
Episode 9,sam,There's a lot more Wildlings on the other side of the wall than this side. We've got us some weapons and things. This is the perfect place for us to be.
Episode 9,sam,"Of course I'm afraid, there's a band of Wildlings coming to kill us."
Episode 9,sam,"I didn't know I was going to kill it, but I had to do something I didn't have any choice, he was going to kill Gilly and take the baby. If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldn't have known. I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore. I wasn't a Steward in the Night's Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that. I was nothing at all. And when you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid."
Episode 9,sam,"Yes, well, I'm not nothing anymore."
Episode 9,sam,Did you get one?
Episode 9,sam,Yeah?
Episode 9,sam,If you keep missing we will.
Episode 9,jon snow,We can't just let them attack the gate!
Episode 9,jon snow,"Those are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them?"
Episode 9,jon snow,Archers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose!
Episode 9,jon snow,They won't summit before dawn.
Episode 9,jon snow,Because I've made that claim.
Episode 9,jon snow,Knock! Draw! Loose!
Episode 9,sam,"Oh, is it over?"
Episode 9,sam,Well then. *hands Pyp a loaded crossbow*
Episode 9,sam,"You're alright. You're alright. I'll get help. Shh, shh. Maester Aemon is coming, he's gonna make it alright."
Episode 9,jon snow,Now!
Episode 9,jon snow,"to Grenn* The outer gate won't hold. Take five men, hold the inner gate."
Episode 9,jon snow,grabs Grenn's arm* Hold the gate. If they make it through...
Episode 9,jon snow,Oil!
Episode 9,sam,to Grenn* We need more men down here.
Episode 9,sam,But we need men here.
Episode 9,sam,to Olly* Get me to the top! You hear me?!
Episode 9,sam,"Your name's Olly, right? Listen to me Olly, get me to the top and when we give a signal, bring us back down. Do you hear me?"
Episode 9,sam,"And find a weapon, Olly. Fight them!"
Episode 9,jon snow,What are you doing up here?
Episode 9,sam,The Wildlings are over the walls. Ser Alliser has fallen. The castle walls can't stand much longer.
Episode 9,jon snow,"Ed. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them."
Episode 9,jon snow,Two brothers now fight with me.
Episode 9,jon snow,to Sam* I don't want you out there.
Episode 9,sam,You can't protect me forever. There won't be anywhere to hide if the castle falls.
Episode 9,jon snow,I need him more than I need you.
Episode 9,sam,We need you boy.
Episode 9,jon snow,"No, shh, don't talk."
Episode 9,jon snow,We'll go back there.
Episode 9,jon snow,"Tormund. It's over, let it end."
Episode 9,jon snow,Put him in chains. We'll question him later.
Episode 9,jon snow,"Aye, you shouldo ve."
Episode 9,sam,"Woah! It's me. It's me. I promised you, didn't I?"
Episode 9,sam,We held them off.
Episode 9,jon snow,For one night.
Episode 9,sam,This is a great victory.
Episode 9,jon snow,"Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them."
Episode 9,sam,Where are you going?
Episode 9,jon snow,I'm going to find Mance.
Episode 9,sam,To...you can't do that. No one gave you any orders.
Episode 9,jon snow,"Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home."
Episode 9,sam,Without Mance? You're going to kill him?
Episode 9,jon snow,I'm going to try.
Episode 9,sam,"They'll never let you within a hundred yards of him. And if you did, even if you managed to kill him."
Episode 9,jon snow,He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too.
Episode 9,sam,He won't just kill ya. They'll boil you. They'll filet you. They'll make it last days!
Episode 9,jon snow,You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan?
Episode 9,jon snow,"They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out."
Episode 9,sam,What are you doing?
Episode 9,jon snow,I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back.
Episode 9,sam,Jon. Come back.
Episode 10,jon snow,I've been sent to negotiate with you.
Episode 10,jon snow,"The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows."
Episode 10,jon snow,She put three arrows in me when I escaped.
Episode 10,jon snow,Yes.
Episode 10,jon snow,She's dead.
Episode 10,jon snow,No.
Episode 10,jon snow,Ygritte.
Episode 10,jon snow,That's not wine.
Episode 10,jon snow,He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn.
Episode 10,jon snow,Grenn came from a farm.
Episode 10,jon snow,Grenn and Mag.
Episode 10,jon snow,Turn your army around and go home.
Episode 10,jon snow,I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men.
Episode 10,jon snow,"No, it's like you said, we don't have the men."
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,You're the king beyond the wall?
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,You know who I am?
Episode 10,davos,"This is Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of the seven kingdoms."
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,"I'll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall, I'll have nowhere to put them and nothing to feed them. I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs. Their fate depends on their king."
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,Take these men away.
Episode 10,davos,What are men of the Night's Watch doing in a Wildling camp?
Episode 10,jon snow,I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall.
Episode 10,davos,You're speaking to the one true king boy. You'll address him as your grace.
Episode 10,jon snow,"I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son."
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,Your father was an honorable man.
Episode 10,jon snow,"He was, your grace."
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,What do you think he'd have done with him?
Episode 10,jon snow,"I was this man's prisoner once. He couldo ve tortured me, he couldo ve killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father wouldo ve taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say."
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,Very well. *to Davos* Take him.
Episode 10,jon snow,"Your grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them."
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Bloody Martells.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,"You're dismissed, Grand Maester."
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Not anymore.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,You can save him?
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Do everything you can. Come to me with anything you need.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Will it weaken him?
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Very well then.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,"Not another word. We've been over this, the matter's closed."
Episode 10,cersei lannister,I'm opening it again.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,You are betrothed to Loras Tyrell. Still betrothed to Loras Tyrell and you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,I will not.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,"Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands. Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow. You have, on several occasions, made great claims about your commitment to this family's future. Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was."
Episode 10,cersei lannister,"I don't care. I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son, the king."
Episode 10,tywin lannister,"When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital. I decided to take your brother with me and not you. You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances and if you recall-"
Episode 10,cersei lannister,I'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won. This isn't going to be one of those times.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,Do you think you'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will?
Episode 10,cersei lannister,"When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle at Blackwater, do you remember?! I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen. I was about to give him essence of nightshade, that's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away. Someone awful is coming to take him away."
Episode 10,tywin lannister,No.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,"Joffrey is dead. Myrcella's been sold like livestock. And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy, my last boy. Margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen."
Episode 10,tywin lannister,And how will you do that?
Episode 10,cersei lannister,I'll tell everyone the truth.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,And what truth would that be?
Episode 10,cersei lannister,"You don't know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying, of course it's possible. How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us. One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you wouldo ve known."
Episode 10,tywin lannister,Known what?
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Everything they say is true. About Jaime and me.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,"No, no, no, no, no."
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Your legacy is a lie.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,I don't believe you.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Yes you do.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Jaime.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,"You won. One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself. There's really nothing you wouldn't do, is there?"
Episode 10,cersei lannister,"For my family, no. I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine."
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Tyrion is your family.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,He's not.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,You don't get to choose.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,"I do, so do you. You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world-"
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Are you really mad enough to blame him for that? He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,"A disease doesn't decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does. What do you decide? What do you choose?"
Episode 10,jaime lannister,"The things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you-"
Episode 10,cersei lannister,I choose you.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Those are words.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Yes. Like the ones I just said to father. I told him.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Told him what?
Episode 10,cersei lannister,I told him about us.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,You told him?
Episode 10,cersei lannister,"I told him I wouldn't marry Loras Tyrell. I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you."
Episode 10,jaime lannister,You think he'll just accept that?
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Go and ask him.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,What did you say?
Episode 10,cersei lannister,"I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister. I don't choose Tywin Lannister, I don't love Tywin Lannister. I love my brother. I love my lover. People will whisper, they'll make their jokes. Let them. They're all so small I can't even see them. I only see what matters."
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Someone will walk in.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,I don't care.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,You speak it very well.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration. What can I do for you?
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,"My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order my friend, this I promise you."
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,What is it that you want from me?
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,"You want to return to a man who owned you, like a goat or a chair?"
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy. I took it to bring people freedom. But freedom means making your own choices. I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master. It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,Approach my friend.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,What was her name?
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,How old was she?
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,Three. *in Valyrian* And still no word on Drogon?
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,in Valyrian* Meet me in the catacombs.
Episode 10,jon snow,"He's sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe."
Episode 10,jon snow,No one's going to torture you.
Episode 10,jon snow,I don't know what happens to the prisoners.
Episode 10,jon snow,I suppose Stannis does.
Episode 10,jon snow,I don't have a king.
Episode 10,jon snow,We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead. Do you want to say any words over them?
Episode 10,jon snow,Funeral words. I don't know how the Free Folk do it.
Episode 10,jon snow,Say farewell.
Episode 10,jon snow,She told you?
Episode 10,brienne,Podrick. Podrick! Where are the horses?
Episode 10,brienne,What sort of hobble?
Episode 10,brienne,If you did it like I taught you then the horses would be here.
Episode 10,brienne,It's at least thirty miles to the Eyrie from here. You're carrying the saddle bags.
Episode 10,arya stark,"People coming. You can shit later, there's people coming!"
Episode 10,brienne,Morning!
Episode 10,arya stark,Morning.
Episode 10,brienne,I like your sword. Are we getting close to the bloody gate?
Episode 10,arya stark,About ten more miles.
Episode 10,brienne,Did you hear that Podrick? Only about ten more miles to the Bloody Gate.
Episode 10,arya stark,Are you a knight?
Episode 10,brienne,No.
Episode 10,arya stark,But you know how to use that sword.
Episode 10,brienne,I do.
Episode 10,arya stark,Does it have a name?
Episode 10,brienne,Oathkeeper.”
Episode 10,arya stark,Mine's “Needle.”
Episode 10,brienne,Good name.
Episode 10,arya stark,Who taught you how to fight?
Episode 10,brienne,My father.
Episode 10,arya stark,Mine never wanted to. Said fighting was for boys.
Episode 10,brienne,"Mine said the same. But I kept fighting the boys anyway. Kept losing. Finally my father said, “If you're going to do it, you might as well do it right.”"
Episode 10,brienne,"Seven blessings. I'm Brienne of Tarth, this is Podrick Payne."
Episode 10,brienne,You're Arya Stark.
Episode 10,brienne,I swore to your mother I would bring you home to her.
Episode 10,arya stark,My mother's dead.
Episode 10,brienne,I know. I wish I couldo ve been there to protect her.
Episode 10,arya stark,You're not a northerner.
Episode 10,brienne,"I know, but I swore a sacred vow to protect her."
Episode 10,arya stark,Why didn't you?
Episode 10,brienne,She commanded me to bring Jaime Lannister back to King's Landing.
Episode 10,brienne,I'm not paid by the Lannisters.
Episode 10,brienne,Jaime Lannister gave me this sword.
Episode 10,arya stark,The Bloody Gate's ten miles.
Episode 10,brienne,I swore to your mother by the Old Gods and the New -
Episode 10,arya stark,I don't care what you swore!
Episode 10,brienne,Arya!
Episode 10,brienne,She is.
Episode 10,brienne,Come with me Arya. I'll take you to safety.
Episode 10,brienne,And that's what you're doing? Watching over her?
Episode 10,brienne,I have no wish to kill you Ser.
Episode 10,brienne,Arya! Arya! ARYA! Where is she?
Episode 10,brienne,Why weren't you watching her?
Episode 10,brienne,Which way Pod? Which way did she go?
Episode 10,arya stark,I don't need saving.
Episode 10,arya stark,You're gonna die?
Episode 10,arya stark,I'll last longer than you.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"Oh, get on with it you son of a whore."
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Is that any way to speak about our mother?
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,What're you doing?
Episode 10,jaime lannister,What do you think I'm doing? The galley's waiting in the bay bound for the Free Cities.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Who's helping you?
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Varys.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Varys?
Episode 10,jaime lannister,You have more friends than you thought.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,"There's a locked door at the top of the stairs. Knock on it twice, and then twice again. Varys will open."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"I suppose this is goodbye, then."
Episode 10,jaime lannister,"Farewell, little brother."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"Jaime, thank you. For my life."
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Quickly now.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,"Tyrion! Put down the crossbow. Who released you? Ah, your brother ,I expect. He always had a soft spot for you. Come, we'll go and talk in my chambers. Is this how you want to speak to me? Shaming your father has always given you pleasure…"
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"All my life, you've wanted me dead."
Episode 10,tywin lannister,"Yes. But you refused to die. I respect that, even admire it. You fight for what's yours. I'd never let them execute you; is that what you fear? I'd never let Illyn Payne take your head. You're a Lannister. You're my son."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,I loved her.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,Who?
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Shae.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,"Bah, Tyrion. Put down that crossbow."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,I murdered her. With my own hands.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,It doesn't matter.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,It doesn't matter?
Episode 10,tywin lannister,She was a whore!
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Say that word again.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,And what? You'll kill your own father in the privy? No. You're my son. Enough of this nonsense…
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"I am your son, and you sentenced me to die. You knew I didn't poison Joffrey, but you sentenced me all the same. Why?"
Episode 10,tywin lannister,Enough. We'll go back to my chambers and speak with some dignity.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,I can't go back there. She's in there.
Episode 10,tywin lannister,"What, are you afraid of a dead whore?"
Episode 10,tywin lannister,You shot me. You're no son of mine.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,I am your son. I have always been your son.
Episode 10,varys,"What have you done? Quickly. Trust me, my friend, I've brought you this far."
Episode 10,arya stark,I want to see the captain.
Episode 10,arya stark,"I want to go north, to the wall."
Episode 10,arya stark,I can pay.
Episode 10,arya stark,"I wouldn't need a cabin. Please, I could work, scrubbing the floors, or…"
Episode 10,arya stark,Where's home?
Episode 10,arya stark,"Wait, I have something else."
Episode 10,arya stark,"It's not silver, it's iron."
Episode 10,arya stark,Valar morghulis.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Why not?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,He'll never know we've been gone.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,You don't need to be afraid of my father.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Yes.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Of course we should.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,No.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,They said that you were terrifying. With cat's teeth and three eyes. You're not terrifying. You're boring.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,I know you're a witch and you can see the future. Tell me mine.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,This is my father's land. My land. Tell me my future or I'll have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,I've been promised to the prince. When will we marry?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,But I will be queen?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Will the king and I have children?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,That doesn't make sense.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,They will keep waiting. I want a moment alone with him.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,They will wait.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"He never wanted you to be a King's Guard, but here you are, protecting his dead body."
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"What he built. The towers. He built it for us. He meant it for us. They're going to try to take it away, all of it."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,They?
Episode 1,jaime lannister,All of them out there are enemies. They're waiting a night to make sure he's really dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes they'll set to work on tearing us apart.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"They had nothing to do with it. The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart, he's the enemy. I've been telling you for years, you've been defending him for years…"
Episode 1,jaime lannister,This is exactly what they want.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,and now our father is dead. And that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath. Did you set him free?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"Tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose. You killed him by mistake. With stupidity. You're a man of action, aren't you? When it occurs to you to do something you do it, nevermind the consequences. Take a look. Look at the consequences. Here they are. He loved you more than anyone in this world."
Episode 1,varys,Apologies.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,I still don't see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail.
Episode 1,varys,"I saved your life. If they catch you, they catch me. I cannot say I feel overly guilty about leaving you in that “fucking crate”."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Do you know what it's like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes?
Episode 1,varys,No. I only know what it's like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Pentos?
Episode 1,varys,"The home of my colleague. Ilyrio Mopatis. A merchant. He and I met many years ago, through mutual friends. A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was. We tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting the Targaryen restoration. And thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here. Things have gotten worse, not better. Westeros needs to be saved from itself."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Much better.
Episode 1,varys,My lord?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,I don't think I am anymore. A lord. Are you a lord if you kill your father? I don't suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore. That has to be happen all the time.
Episode 1,varys,You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,In a box. Why stop now?
Episode 1,varys,Because we are talking about the future of our country.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,The future is shit. Just like the past.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Sons of the Harpy?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,They've never killed before.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,I didn't conquer them. Their own people did.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,"Then they will have to learn to see things differently, Mossador. He did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away. And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos. What was the name of the man you lost?"
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,I want him buried with honor. Publicly. In the Temple of the Graces.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Angry snakes lash out. Makes chopping off their heads that much easier. Find the men who did this and bring them to me.
Episode 1,jon snow,Get your shield up.
Episode 1,jon snow,"If it wasn't heavy it wouldn't stop a sword, now get it up."
Episode 1,jon snow,Come. Try it again. Drive at me. Keep your shield up. Or I'll ring your head like a bell.
Episode 1,sam,"Well, I'm hardly a new recruit. How many brothers can say they've killed a white walker and a Thenn? I might be the first in history!"
Episode 1,sam,If Ser Alliser is chosen as the new Lord Commander… he hates the wildlings.
Episode 1,sam,All the wildlings.
Episode 1,sam,"It's not a sure thing. Ser Denys Mallister has commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years, and people say he's a good man. He's running against Ser Alliser--"
Episode 1,sam,"I told you. Wherever you go, I go, too."
Episode 1,jon snow,"Good, good, pivot! Don't forget to pivot! Shield up!"
Episode 1,jon snow,"You're not cold, my lady?"
Episode 1,jon snow,No.
Episode 1,stannis baratheon,You know who rules at Winterfell now?
Episode 1,jon snow,Roose Bolton.
Episode 1,stannis baratheon,The traitor who plunged a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. Don't you want to avenge him?
Episode 1,jon snow,"I want a great many things, your grace. But I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch now."
Episode 1,davos,I've been talking to your sworn brothers. Many of them love you.
Episode 1,jon snow,They're good men.
Episode 1,davos,Many don't. You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall. Why?
Episode 1,jon snow,It's where she belonged.
Episode 1,davos,Some of the Night's Watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings.
Episode 1,jon snow,They were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesn't make them monsters.
Episode 1,stannis baratheon,No matter. I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it. Tywin Lannister is dead. He can't protect them now. I shall mount Roose Bolton's head on a spike. But if I'm to take Winterfell I'll need more men.
Episode 1,jon snow,The men of the Night's Watch are sworn to play no part--
Episode 1,stannis baratheon,I'm not talking about the damn Night's Watch. I'm talking about the wildlings.
Episode 1,jon snow,"Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army?"
Episode 1,stannis baratheon,"If they swear to follow me, I'll pardon them. We'll take Winterfell. Once the North is won, I'll declare them citizens of the realm. I'll give them land to live on."
Episode 1,davos,It's a fair offer. More than fair.
Episode 1,stannis baratheon,I'll offer them their lives and their freedom if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty.
Episode 1,jon snow,I don't think that's likely.
Episode 1,stannis baratheon,"You admire him, don't you?"
Episode 1,jon snow,I respect him.
Episode 1,stannis baratheon,He likes you. Convince him to bend the knee...
Episode 1,jon snow,Your grace…
Episode 1,stannis baratheon,or he burns.
Episode 1,jon snow,How much time do I have?
Episode 1,stannis baratheon,"Nightfall. The sun drops fast this time of year. Hurry, Jon Snow."
Episode 1,petyr baelish,Lord Arryn will never be a great warrior.
Episode 1,petyr baelish,Some boys develop more slowly. He's still young.
Episode 1,petyr baelish,He has other gifts.
Episode 1,petyr baelish,The gift of a great name. Sometimes that's all one needs.
Episode 1,sansa stark,"Goodbye Lord Royce, and thank you for all you've done for me."
Episode 1,petyr baelish,"I have no doubt that upon my return, Robin's skills will have improved immeasurably."
Episode 1,brienne,Us? The only reason you're here is that Jaime Lannister told me you weren't safe in the capital. You're hundreds of miles from King's Landing. No one knows what you look like. No one cares. You're safe.
Episode 1,brienne,Do you even know what a squire is?
Episode 1,brienne,I'm not a knight. That means you're not a squire.
Episode 1,brienne,"I don't care, I'm not your mother."
Episode 1,brienne,I found Arya. She didn't want my protection.
Episode 1,brienne,Will you shut your mouth? I didn't ask for advice. I don't want anyone following me. I'm not a leader. All I ever wanted is to fight for a Lord I believed in. The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.
Episode 1,sansa stark,You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.
Episode 1,petyr baelish,I did.
Episode 1,sansa stark,But we're heading west.
Episode 1,petyr baelish,We are.
Episode 1,sansa stark,"If he wanted to betray us, he already would have."
Episode 1,petyr baelish,"Lord Royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is, but he's not alone in that castle. Do you trust all those knights and ladies, stable boys and serving girls?"
Episode 1,sansa stark,No. Do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us?
Episode 1,petyr baelish,"No. But I pay them well, and they've seen what happens to men who disappoint me."
Episode 1,sansa stark,So where are we going? To a land where you trust everyone?
Episode 1,petyr baelish,"So a land so far from here, even Cersei Lannister can't get her hands on you."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Thank you so much for your kind words.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"Uncle, it's quite alright."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,I'm sure he'll grow out of it. Whatever it is. Excuse me.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,What can I do for you?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,I doubt you've ever led anyone anywhere.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,I don't know what you're talking about.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,The day Tywin Lannister's soul needs your help…
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Eunuch, the spider, the master of whisperers."
Episode 1,varys,"Imp, half-man."
Episode 1,varys,There are faster ways to kill yourself.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Not for a coward.
Episode 1,varys,"You are many things, my friend, but not a coward."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,You never told me why you set me free.
Episode 1,varys,Your brother asked me to.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,You could have said no.
Episode 1,varys,Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You're not family, you owe me nothing."
Episode 1,varys,I didn't do it for you. I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.
Episode 1,varys,I don't believe in saviors. I believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,You're going to have to find another soldier. I'm done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.
Episode 1,varys,"You have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them. Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power. But earning it for yourself, that takes work."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,I'm not well-suited for work.
Episode 1,varys,"I think you are. You have your father's instinct for politics, and you have compassion."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.
Episode 1,varys,I never said you were perfect.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,What is it you want exactly?
Episode 1,varys,Peace. Prosperity. A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that's how they became powerful in the first place."
Episode 1,varys,"Perhaps. And perhaps we've grown so used to horror we assume there's no other way. If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?"
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,I will never sit on the Iron Throne.
Episode 1,varys,"No, you won't. But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat. The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis. A monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people. A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Good luck finding him.
Episode 1,varys,"Who said anything about him? You have a choice my friend. You can stay here at Ilyrio's palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Mereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Good.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Concessions?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,I'm not a politician. I'm a queen.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,"I don't expect the Wise Masters to be happy. Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery."
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,No fighting pits.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,How many times must I say no before you understand?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Whatever he wants from me he's not going to get it. If he really believes I'm going to reopen the fighting pits…
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,What?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Why?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,"You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you're defending the fighting pits?"
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,That's why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,I don't want another childo s bones dropped at my feet. No one's seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know he's flown halfway across the world. I can't control them anymore.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Viserion? Rhaegal?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Easy. Easy. Easy.
Episode 1,jon snow,Here we are.
Episode 1,jon snow,This doesn't have to be our last meeting.
Episode 1,jon snow,You know what Stannis wants?
Episode 1,jon snow,Shouldn't a king be bold?
Episode 1,jon snow,You told me you weren't here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough.
Episode 1,jon snow,"You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life's work uniting them. You didn't do it for power. You didn't do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they're north of the wall. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?"
Episode 1,jon snow,Then bend the knee and save your people.
Episode 1,jon snow,And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won't go out and rescue them because why? You're afraid of looking afraid.
Episode 1,jon snow,They'll burn you alive.
Episode 1,jon snow,"And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they'll sing songs about you. “You'd rather burn than kneel. The great hero.” Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there's no one left to sing."
Episode 1,jon snow,I think you're making a terrible mistake.
Episode 1,stannis baratheon,"Mance Rayder, you've been called the King Beyond the Wall. Westeros only has one king. Bend the knee, I promise you mercy."
Episode 1,stannis baratheon,Kneel and live.
Episode 2,arya stark,He's just a statue.
Episode 2,arya stark,I'm not afraid.
Episode 2,arya stark,Thank you for bringing me.
Episode 2,arya stark,Valar dohaeris.
Episode 2,arya stark,Hello. Valar Morghulis.
Episode 2,arya stark,Jaqen H'ghar gave me this.
Episode 2,arya stark,Please. I crossed the Narrow Sea. I have nowhere else to go.
Episode 2,arya stark,But wait!
Episode 2,arya stark,"Cersei, Walder Frey, The Mountain, Meryn Trant. Cersei, Walder Frey, The Mountain, Meryn Trant."
Episode 2,arya stark,"The Mountain, Meryn Trant."
Episode 2,sansa stark,"Before we left, a maester gave you a raven scroll."
Episode 2,petyr baelish,You are becoming an observant young lady.
Episode 2,sansa stark,"My mother used to say, ""dark wings, dark words""."
Episode 2,petyr baelish,An old saying. Inaccurate in this case.
Episode 2,sansa stark,So it was good news.?
Episode 2,petyr baelish,My marriage proposal has been accepted.
Episode 2,sansa stark,I thought you still mourn the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa.
Episode 2,sansa stark,I'll have some.
Episode 2,brienne,What is it?
Episode 2,brienne,You sure?
Episode 2,brienne,Littlefinger?
Episode 2,brienne,Bunch? What's a bunch? 100? 6? 20?
Episode 2,brienne,Ready the horses.
Episode 2,brienne,Find more.
Episode 2,petyr baelish,Do you like the taste?
Episode 2,sansa stark,I don't see what all the fuss is about. Why do men love it so much?
Episode 2,petyr baelish,It gives some men courage.
Episode 2,sansa stark,Does it give you courage?
Episode 2,brienne,"Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa, my name is Brienne of Tarth."
Episode 2,petyr baelish,"We've met. With Renly Baratheon. What did he say about you? He said, ""You're a loyalty comes free of charge."" Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then."
Episode 2,brienne,"Lady Sansa, before your mother's death, I was her sworn sword. I gave my word I would find you and protect you. I will shield your back and keep your council, and give my life for yours if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new."
Episode 2,petyr baelish,"Please, Lady Brienne. No need for such formality. You are Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?"
Episode 2,brienne,I was.
Episode 2,petyr baelish,Strange. I knew Cat from the time we were children. She never mentioned you.
Episode 2,brienne,It was after Renly's murder.
Episode 2,petyr baelish,"Ah, yes. You were accused of killing him."
Episode 2,brienne,I tried to save him.
Episode 2,petyr baelish,But you were accused.
Episode 2,brienne,By men who didn't see what happened.
Episode 2,petyr baelish,Then what did happen?
Episode 2,brienne,He was murdered by a shadow. A shadow with a face of Stannis Baratheon.
Episode 2,petyr baelish,A shadow? With a face? This woman swore to protect Renly; she failed. She swore to protect your mother; she failed. Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guiding Lady Sansa?
Episode 2,brienne,Why should you have any say in her affairs?
Episode 2,petyr baelish,"Because I am her uncle. I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my belovedo s untimely death. We're family now, and you're an outsider. Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experiences made me wary of outsiders."
Episode 2,brienne,"Lady Sansa, if we can have a word alone--"
Episode 2,sansa stark,No.
Episode 2,brienne,"Please, my lady. If I could explain--"
Episode 2,sansa stark,I saw you at Joffrey's wedding bowing to the king.
Episode 2,brienne,Neither of us wanted to be there. Sometimes we don't have a choice.
Episode 2,sansa stark,And sometimes we do. You should leave.
Episode 2,petyr baelish,We don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone. The roads of these parts aren't safe. Why don't you stay?
Episode 2,brienne,Podrick!
Episode 2,brienne,"Down, Podrick, down!"
Episode 2,brienne,Podrick?
Episode 2,brienne,You can stand now.
Episode 2,brienne,"Wary of strangers, as she should me. I saw her riding on the East Trail with Littlefinger. We'll follow them."
Episode 2,brienne,I swore to their mother I'd protect those girls.
Episode 2,brienne,Do you think she's safe from Littlefinger?
Episode 2,brienne,Get your horse.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,A summons from the queen.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,There are only two like it in the world
Episode 2,jaime lannister,It's a threat.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"Of course it's a threat! Our daughter's in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family. ""It's a threat."""
Episode 2,jaime lannister,No note.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister, and every other tragedy that's befallen their cursed country. I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her!"
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Softer.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,What?
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Not so loud.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"Our daughter's in danger, and you're worried I'm speaking too loudly!"
Episode 2,jaime lannister,The world can't know knows she's our daughter.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Then don't call her your daughter. You've never been a father to her.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"If I was the father to any of my children, they'd be stoned in the streets."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,And what has your caution brought? Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding. Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne. Our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,I'll make things better.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,You never made anything better.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,I'm going to Dorne. I'll bring our daughter home.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,You can't just ask Prince Doran to give her back! She's promised his son.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,I'm not going to ask him anything.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"You go there with an army, it's an act of war."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,No army. Do you know where they're keeping her?
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"I'll find her. Is there anything else, your grace?"
Episode 2,cersei lannister,You're going to Dorne? A one-handed man? Alone?
Episode 2,jaime lannister,I never said I was going alone.
Episode 2,bronn,Don't who?
Episode 2,bronn,"They certainly do, my dear. They certainly do."
Episode 2,bronn,"It's a fine place, isn't it? A fine place. I never thought I'd end up settling down in a place like this."
Episode 2,bronn,Pardon?
Episode 2,bronn,Oh.
Episode 2,bronn,You know what I think? I think you're a good person. And your sister is a mean person.
Episode 2,bronn,"I've been all over the world. And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that meanness comes around. People like your sister, they always get what's coming to them eventually. One way or another."
Episode 2,bronn,Jaime fucking Lannister.
Episode 2,bronn,Ser Jaime.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
Episode 2,bronn,I was very sorry to hear about your father.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Thank you.
Episode 2,bronn,"This is my betrothed, Lollys."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,A pleasure.
Episode 2,bronn,"Run along, love."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Beautiful bride you've chosen. When were you planning on getting married?
Episode 2,bronn,Just get on with it.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,On with what?
Episode 2,bronn,What you're here for. There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,It's very good for you.
Episode 2,bronn,Lollys will be marrying Ser Wyllis Bracken.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Mmm.
Episode 2,bronn,"We made a deal, your sister and I."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,I would have advised against that.
Episode 2,bronn,How is this good for me?
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"Cause you're going to come with me and help me with something important. And when we return, I'm going to give you a much better girl, and a much better castle."
Episode 2,bronn,Return from where?
Episode 2,jaime lannister,As far south as south goes.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,It would send a message.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Why?
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Thank you all for your counsel.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,About what?
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,The Mad King? You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies? Consider me reminded.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Go on.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,I'm not my father.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,There's a bug.
Episode 2,varys,"Yes, best be careful. You might accidentally consume some solid food."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box?"
Episode 2,varys,You don't like it?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I want to take a walk.
Episode 2,varys,You can't. Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere."
Episode 2,varys,Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,You're right. No point. The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?
Episode 2,varys,The road to Meereen.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?
Episode 2,varys,I told you. A ruler.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,We've already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it.
Episode 2,varys,"You were quite good, you know. At ruling. During your brief tenure as Hand."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I didn't rule. I was a servant.
Episode 2,varys,"Still, a man of talent."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Managed to kill a lot of people.
Episode 2,varys,"Yes, but showed great promise in other areas as well."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,She wanted me to leave King's Landing. She begged me. I wouldn't go.
Episode 2,varys,Why?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant.
Episode 2,varys,People follow leaders. And they will never follow us. They find us repulsive.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I find us repulsive.
Episode 2,varys,"And we find them repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large, comfortable boxes to keep them away. And yet, no matter what we do, people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box. Not for long."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,You're right. Let's go for a walk.
Episode 2,varys,No.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all?
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Not him.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn. I don't want to dissuade the other hunters. Mistakes will be made."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Take the head.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Very good.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"No, Uncle. Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"You're a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I don't imagine you'll have the time. In addition to being Master of Ships, the king has appointed you Master of Coin."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled. He said he would be honored to have you represent the crown's interests in the same.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,The King has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester. That's far more than the eunuch ever had. Far more than many ever have."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies, it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War. No man living better deserves the title."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,The king is very busy at this moment.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"He is learning. On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,That is not your concern as Master of War.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,You would abandon your king in his time of need?
Episode 2,sam,"Hmm! Did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10?"
Episode 2,sam,"I only said that the more time you spend practicing, the faster you'll be able to read."
Episode 2,sam,"Three?! Who taught you, your mother?"
Episode 2,sam,Did you ever see them?
Episode 2,sam,Your Grace.
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,"I ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake. You prevented that order from being carried out. You showed mercy to Mance Rayder. A king's word is law. Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers. Show too much kindness, people won't fear you. If people don't fear you, they don't follow you."
Episode 2,jon snow,"With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive."
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,Who then? You?
Episode 2,jon snow,No. Only one of their own.
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,Do you know this wretched girl Lyanna Mormont?
Episode 2,jon snow,The Lord Commander's niece.
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,"Lady of Bear Island, and a child of 10. I asked her to commit her house to my cause, that's her response."
Episode 2,jon snow,"Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark."
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,That amuses you?
Episode 2,jon snow,"I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own."
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,I know. My brother Robert went on often and loudly about how difficult it was to control them - even with your father's help.
Episode 2,davos,"Tonight, the Night's Watch elect a new Lord Commander. Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win."
Episode 2,jon snow,Most likely.
Episode 2,davos,Unpleasant man. He thinks you're a traitor. What's your life going to be like on the Wall with Thorne in command?
Episode 2,jon snow,"Unpleasant, I expect."
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,Your bravery made him look weak. He'll punish you for it. I don't punish men for bravery. I reward them.
Episode 2,jon snow,"I don't doubt it, Your Grace. But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you."
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,You can give me the North.
Episode 2,jon snow,"I can't. Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard. A Snow."
Episode 2,stannis baratheon,"Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet. Pledge me your service and you'll rise again as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell."
Episode 2,sam,He'll make you a Stark with the stroke of a pen?
Episode 2,jon snow,"It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again."
Episode 2,sam,You deserve this. You do. I couldn't be happier for you.
Episode 2,jon snow,I'm going to refuse him.
Episode 2,sam,But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.
Episode 2,jon snow,"I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?"
Episode 2,sam,Maester Aemon.
Episode 2,sam,Her name is Gilly. Brother Slynt knows her quite well. They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall.
Episode 2,sam,"A wildling girl, a baby, and Lord Janos. I found him there when the battle was over in a puddle of his own making."
Episode 2,sam,"Whilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children, Jon Snow was leading."
Episode 2,sam,"Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true. And when he was wounded, it is Jon who saved us. He took charge of the wall's defense. He killed the Magnar of the Thenns. He went North to deal with Mance Rayder, knowing it almost certainly meant his own death. Before that, he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont. Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward. He saw something in Jon, and now we've all seen it, too. He may be young, but he's the commander we turned to when the night was darkest."
Episode 2,arya stark,Turn around and go. Turn around and go.
Episode 2,arya stark,Nothing's worth anything to dead men.
Episode 2,arya stark,Who are you? Why were they scared of you?
Episode 2,arya stark,You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.
Episode 2,arya stark,Well who are you then?
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"He was our prisoner, awaiting trial. You had no right."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,There are no more slaves. There are no more Masters.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"The Harpy's life was not yours to take. Once, the Masters were the law--"
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,The law is the law. Take him.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,You opened your gates to me because I promised you freedom and justice. One cannot exist without the other.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,A citizen of Meereen was awaiting trial and this man murdered him. The punishment is death.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Leave me.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Drogon...
Episode 3,arya stark,I've been sweeping this floor for days.
Episode 3,arya stark,I didn't come here to sweep floors.
Episode 3,arya stark,You said that I could be your apprentice. You said you'd teach me how to a Faceless Man.
Episode 3,arya stark,I want to serve. .
Episode 3,arya stark,Which one is the Many-Faced God? I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God. I see the Weirwood Face.
Episode 3,arya stark,Where are they taking him?
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"You look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She's certainly very pretty, isn't she? Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot. Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell. Not that it matters."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?
Episode 3,cersei lannister,This is my real home now. Where my family lives.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"I know that. I know you do, my sweet boy."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Don't you look lovely. Marriage agrees with you.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"No, no. I, I can't stay. I just wanted to let you know if, there is ever anything I can do for you."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Good. Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,I'll leave you to it then. .
Episode 3,cersei lannister,There's no need for such formalities.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Won't that be a lovely day.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Remember. Anything you need.
Episode 3,sansa stark,That's Moat Cailin.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"Yes. A bit shabby, isn't it? You've been here before."
Episode 3,sansa stark,"On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and… where are you taking me?"
Episode 3,petyr baelish,Home.
Episode 3,sansa stark,"The Boltons have Winterfell. . The marriage proposal, it wasn't for you?"
Episode 3,petyr baelish,No.
Episode 3,sansa stark,Roose Bolton murdered my brother. He betrayed my family!
Episode 3,petyr baelish,He did.
Episode 3,sansa stark,He serves the Lannisters.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,For now.
Episode 3,sansa stark,I won't go.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,Winterfell is your home.
Episode 3,sansa stark,Not anymore.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,Always. You're a Stark. Dyeing your hair doesn't change that. You're Sansa Stark. The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark. Your place is in the North.
Episode 3,sansa stark,I can't marry him. You can't make me. He's a traitor. A murderer.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"You're not marrying Roose Bolton. No, you'll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay. One day he'll be Warden of the North and you will -"
Episode 3,sansa stark,No!
Episode 3,petyr baelish,Sansa -
Episode 3,sansa stark,"No, you can't make me. I will starve myself. I will die before I have to go there."
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"I won't force you to do anything. Don't you know by now how much I care for you? Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me. Listen. . You've been running all your life. Terrible things happened to your family and you weep. You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates. You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father. Stop being a bystander, do you hear me? Stop running. There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it. You loved your family. Avenge them."
Episode 3,brienne,We don't. We go around. .
Episode 3,brienne,Doesn't matter. I know where they're going.
Episode 3,brienne,Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp?
Episode 3,brienne,"Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?"
Episode 3,brienne,He borrowed it?
Episode 3,brienne,As punishment. For both of you.
Episode 3,brienne,"Yes, all of your lords were very kind to you. All except me. Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person."
Episode 3,brienne,I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.
Episode 3,brienne,"You want to be a knight, Pod?"
Episode 3,brienne,"Starting tomorrow, we'll train with the sword twice a day, before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening. . And I'm going to show you how to ride properly."
Episode 3,brienne,"I can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight."
Episode 3,brienne,I was.
Episode 3,brienne,He was.
Episode 3,brienne,"When I was a girl, my father held a ball. I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me. He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. . And it was wonderful. None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance. And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. . My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. I'd never been so happy. . Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. ‘Brienne the Beauty', they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. “Don't let them see your tears,” he told me. “They're nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.” He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. And he was the king's brother after all."
Episode 3,brienne,"Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot. He didn't love me, he didn't want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt. He saved me from being a joke. From that day until his last day. And I couldn't save him in return. Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love. One day, I will avenge King Renly."
Episode 3,brienne,"A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. Stannis is a man, not a shadow. And a man can be killed."
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,Lord Commander.
Episode 3,jon snow,Your Grace.
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,I'd like to speak alone.
Episode 3,jon snow,"Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command."
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,Very well. . Have you considered my offer?
Episode 3,jon snow,I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,Say the word and you will be.
Episode 3,jon snow,But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family. To take back the castle where you grew up. To rule the North.
Episode 3,jon snow,"I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch."
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,You're as stubborn as your father. And as honorable.
Episode 3,jon snow,I can imagine no higher praise.
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,"I didn't mean it as praise. Honor got your father killed. . But if your mindo s made up, I won't try to persuade you."
Episode 3,jon snow,"May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?"
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,Are you bored of us already?
Episode 3,jon snow,You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,I know it. We march on Winterfell within the fortnight. Before the snows trap us here.
Episode 3,jon snow,And the wildlings?
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,"They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it. I leave their fate to you. You could execute them, that's the safest course. . Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead."
Episode 3,jon snow,"Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. ."
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,You have many enemies in Castle Black. Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
Episode 3,jon snow,I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.
Episode 3,stannis baratheon,Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.
Episode 3,davos,"He sees something in you. . Might not be apparent from his tone, but it's the truth. He believes in you."
Episode 3,jon snow,I'm sorry I disappointed him.
Episode 3,davos,The king is a complicated man. But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.
Episode 3,jon snow,As long as he's ruling them.
Episode 3,davos,He's the one true king. He has the blood right to that throne.
Episode 3,jon snow,I've sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.
Episode 3,davos,Have you now? . How does the Night's Watch vow go again? I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.
Episode 3,davos,"Not that bit, the bit at the end."
Episode 3,davos,"Wait, that's enough. “The shield that guards the realm of men.” That's what you swore to be. Now I'm not a learned man, but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world. It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty, and doing what needs to be doing."
Episode 3,jon snow,And what needs to be done?
Episode 3,davos,"As long as the Boltons rule the North, , the North will suffer. Just one man's opinion."
Episode 3,arya stark,What do you want?
Episode 3,arya stark,What?
Episode 3,arya stark,No one.
Episode 3,arya stark,Ow! Cunt!
Episode 3,arya stark,"I told you, I'm no - . Do that again and -"
Episode 3,arya stark,You're about to find out.
Episode 3,arya stark,I am ready.
Episode 3,arya stark,What do we do with them after we wash them?
Episode 3,sansa stark,Lord Bolton.
Episode 3,sansa stark,Thank you.
Episode 3,jon snow,Sam. . Maester Aemon?
Episode 3,sam,He apologizes for not being here. He's not feeling well.
Episode 3,jon snow,"Take good care of him. . Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. . First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. . Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger."
Episode 3,jon snow,"Ser Alliser. . You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger."
Episode 3,jon snow,Lord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard.
Episode 3,jon snow,"Yes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his -"
Episode 3,sam,"Alright, alright! Enough of that."
Episode 3,jon snow,"You mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard."
Episode 3,jon snow,Are you refusing to obey my order?
Episode 3,jon snow,Take Lord Janos outside.
Episode 3,jon snow,"Olly, bring me my sword."
Episode 3,jon snow,"If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,You were assaulted?
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"What do you want from us, High Septon?"
Episode 3,cersei lannister,And where do I find this man? This High Sparrow?
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"Nonsense, Ser Meryn. These are deeply religious people. . Where can I find the High Sparrow?"
Episode 3,cersei lannister,A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here. Where is he?
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Why no shoes?
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Is that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone?
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Perhaps they're right.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?"
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"The High Septon came to speak to me today. He doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"My thoughts on the matter align with your own. The High Septon's behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude. Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside. So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead. . The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. If one collapses, so does the other. We must do everything necessary to protect one another."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie, or wherever he's slithering about. ."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,How's your work coming along?
Episode 3,cersei lannister,You've made progress?
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"Very good. I'll leave you to it then. Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word ""immediately""."
Episode 3,petyr baelish,I hope so too. I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together. She's suffered enough.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"I've heard very little about you. Which makes you quite a rare thing, as lords go."
Episode 3,petyr baelish,He seems pleased.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"I assure you she's still a virgin. Tyrion never consummated the marriage. By the law of the land, she's no man's wife. Inspect her, if you must."
Episode 3,petyr baelish,Then I have delivered everything I've promised.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did. Tywin is dead. He kept his house in power through sheer will. Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies, Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear."
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"Queen Margaery adores Sansa. Cersei is Queen Mother, a title whose importance wanes with each passing day."
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"A message for me, you say. Strange that the seal is broken."
Episode 3,petyr baelish,Every ambitious move is a gamble. You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. It appears that your gamble paid off. You're Warden of the North.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"The Eyrie is mine. The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known. I'd like to borrow one of your birds. Cersei will expect a reply."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,I have to get out of this wheelhouse.
Episode 3,varys,Volantis is a large city.
Episode 3,varys,The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Mm, I have to get out of this wheelhouse."
Episode 3,varys,I'm not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind. I can't remember the last face I saw that wasn't yours.
Episode 3,varys,It's a perfectly good face.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,I'm losing my mind.
Episode 3,varys,"If anyone recognizes you, you'll lose more than that."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Look, we are thousands of miles from Westeros. . What am I? . One more drunk dwarf."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Slaves.
Episode 3,varys,Yes. The Volantene masters are very organized. . Flies for dung shovelers. . Hammers for builders. . Tears for whores. Lest they forget.
Episode 3,varys,We should keep moving.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,The only red priest we had in King's Landing was Thoros of Myr. This one's much better looking.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Stone men. Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer. You'd have better luck dancing away the plague. .
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,We're going to meet the Saviour! You should have told me. Who doesn't want to meet the Saviour?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Come on. Let's find a brothel.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,It's even better luck to suck a dwarf's cock.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"See? We blend right in. Just two more travellers, mad with lust."
Episode 3,varys,Thank you.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Curious... hair. .
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,It appears you're not the only Targaryen supporter.
Episode 3,varys,Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Well, , she's taken."
Episode 3,varys,Where're you going?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,I need to speak to someone with hair.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Hello?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,You've got no drink.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Do I look like a man without money? . Never trust looks. Until quite recently, I was one of the richest men in the world. . But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh? . I always pay my debts, I'm well known for it."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,That's because they've never met a queen.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"You know how to spot a liar. If I could pick any girl here, I would pick you."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Because you have a skeptical mind.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"I'm, I'm sorry, I can't."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,I'm not.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Gladly, but this, I can't do. Believe me, no one is more shocked than I am. I hope it passes. What will I do in my spare time? I'll go for a piss, that's a start."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"No need to worry, I was just - . Oh, I thought you were someone else. Shows almost over. I'm sure the girls inside will be happy to oblige."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,You made some kind of mistake. Why don't you tell me what you think you are doing and -
Episode 3,jorah mormont,I'm taking you to the Queen.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Is that Estermont?
Episode 4,bronn,Why are we on a merchant ship? Why no Lannister sails?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"This ship's sailing to Oldtown. We'll get off earlier, not far from Sunspear. Row ourselves to the Dornish shores in the night."
Episode 4,bronn,You ever been to Dorne?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,No.
Episode 4,bronn,I have. The Dornish are crazy. All they want to do is fight and fuck. Fuck and fight.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,You should be happy to go back. .
Episode 4,bronn,"There's nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for fucking. . And there's nothing like a fuck-mad Dornish girl to clear your head for the next fight. It's how the two work together. And we're gonna do a lot of fighting, I am sure. Well, I am. But I don't imagine we'll get to stick around for the rest. Not after we've kidnapped their princess."
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"We are not kidnapping their princess. We are rescuing my niece, bringing her back to the family,"
Episode 4,bronn,Your niece?
Episode 4,bronn,I've been doing this sort of thing a long time. I'm good at it. .
Episode 4,jaime lannister,That's why you're here.
Episode 4,bronn,"I know. Why are you here? Why not send 40 of me, or an army? Unlike most folks, you actually got one."
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Because I don't want to start a war.
Episode 4,bronn,That still doesn't explain why you're doing it.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,It has to be me.
Episode 4,bronn,"If I'm putting something of a lit together, a one-handed man, , who happens to be one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros, is not -"
Episode 4,bronn,"You set your brother free, didn't you? I bet your sister didn't like that."
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Varys set him free.
Episode 4,bronn,"Well, if you ever see the little fucker, , give him my regards."
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"He murdered my father. If I ever see him, I'll split him in two. And then I'll give him your regards."
Episode 4,cersei lannister,How much can the Crown afford?
Episode 4,cersei lannister,You're the Master of Coin. How do we pay them?
Episode 4,cersei lannister,"You've already given us too much. . No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank."
Episode 4,cersei lannister,In person.
Episode 4,cersei lannister,"We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank, someone of importance, to show these bankers our respect. As the King's Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified."
Episode 4,cersei lannister,The King has expressed concern about his father-in-law's safety on this voyage. . He's ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort.
Episode 4,cersei lannister,"Safe travels, Lord Tyrell."
Episode 4,cersei lannister,Not small enough.
Episode 4,cersei lannister,"May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness?"
Episode 4,cersei lannister,The old High Septon would have asked the vintage. .
Episode 4,cersei lannister,Hmm.
Episode 4,cersei lannister,All over Westeros we hear about septs being burned. Silent sisters raped. Bodies of holy men piled in the streets.
Episode 4,cersei lannister,"Perhaps the Gods need a sword of their own. . In the days before the Targaryens, the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven."
Episode 4,cersei lannister,"If I explain the holy purpose to my son, the king, I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy."
Episode 4,cersei lannister,"An army and service to the Gods themselves. And to you, of course. As the chosen representative of the Seven."
Episode 4,cersei lannister,"Which is why you were chosen. . You and I both know how the world works. Too often the wicked are the wealthiest, beyond the reach of justice. The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most."
Episode 4,cersei lannister,What would you say if I told you we have a great sinner in our very midst? Shielded by gold and privilege.
Episode 4,cersei lannister,Did I arrest him?
Episode 4,cersei lannister,"I did. And your wife has every right to criticize. . Can't allow fanatics to arrest the Queen's brother, no matter his perversions."
Episode 4,cersei lannister,"I told you I am not holding Ser Loras. You're the King. I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, he'll release the poor boy."
Episode 4,jon snow,Good.
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,"Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way."
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,Not your fault.
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,We must. To beat the snows.
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,I won't. I need you.
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,"And you, my Lady, what do you need?"
Episode 4,sam,Lord Ashford. . Lady Caulfield. . Lord Smallwood.
Episode 4,jon snow,Never even heard of these people.
Episode 4,sam,They haven't heard of you either. . But we need men and they have some.
Episode 4,jon snow,And how many men does this Lord Mazin have to send us?
Episode 4,sam,More than Lord Wibberley.
Episode 4,jon snow,Not him.
Episode 4,sam,"I know, I'm sorry, but we need men and supplies. And Roose Bolton is the Warden of The North."
Episode 4,jon snow,He murdered my brother.
Episode 4,sam,We swore to be the Watchers on the Wall. We can't watch the Wall with 50 men. And we can't get more men without help from the Warden of the North.
Episode 4,sam,"Apologies, my Lady."
Episode 4,jon snow,How can I help you?
Episode 4,jon snow,Castle Black is my home now. Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.
Episode 4,jon snow,"You're gonna show me some vision in the fire. Forgive me, my Lady. But I don't trust in visions."
Episode 4,jon snow,I don't think Stannis would like that very much.
Episode 4,jon snow,I can't.
Episode 4,jon snow,I swore a vow. . I loved another.
Episode 4,jon snow,I know. But I still love her.
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,Are you lonely?
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources.
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,"I know Castle Black is no place for a child, but I -"
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,Why do you say that?
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,She shouldn't have said that.
Episode 4,stannis baratheon,"When you were an infant, , the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone. His goods were junk except for one wooden doll. He'd even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House. No doubt he'd heard of your birth, and assumed new fathers were easy targets. I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle, , and you pressed it to your cheek. . By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late. . I was told you would die. Or worse, the grayscale would go slow. . Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle. I told them all to go to hell. . I called in every maester on this side of the world. Every healer, every apothecary. They stopped the disease and saved your life. Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men. . You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. And you are my daughter."
Episode 4,petyr baelish,I thought I might find you here. . Your Aunt Lyanna.
Episode 4,sansa stark,"Father never talked about her. Sometimes I'd find him down here, lighting the candles. They say she was beautiful."
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"I saw her once. I was a boy, living with your mother's family. Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal. Everyone was there. The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon. And Lyanna, she was already promised to Robert. You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists. The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen. When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince. I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair. How handsome he was. Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died. I've never seen so many people so quiet. He rode past his wife, and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. Blue as frost. How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?"
Episode 4,sansa stark,"Yes, he chose her… and then he kidnapped her and raped her."
Episode 4,petyr baelish,Come. . Let's speak somewhere the dead can't hear us. .
Episode 4,sansa stark,Dressed for riding?
Episode 4,petyr baelish,I am.
Episode 4,sansa stark,Where are you going?
Episode 4,petyr baelish,King's Landing.
Episode 4,sansa stark,King's Landing?
Episode 4,petyr baelish,Cersei sent for me. . We must not let her sniff out any trouble.
Episode 4,sansa stark,You can't leave me here!
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"I know how hard it is to live with people you despise, believe me. But it won't be for long."
Episode 4,sansa stark,How do you know?
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black. He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way. But first, he has to take Winterfell."
Episode 4,sansa stark,You don't know that.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"I do. Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons he'll rally your father's bannermen to his cause. With the North behind him, Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne."
Episode 4,sansa stark,You think he'll defeat the Boltons?
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"He has a larger army. He's the finest military commander in Westeros. A betting man would put his money on Stannis. . As it happens, I am a betting man."
Episode 4,sansa stark,And if you're right?
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"Stannis takes Winterfell, he rescues you from the most despised family in the North. Grateful for your late father's courageous support for his claim, he names you Wardeness of the North."
Episode 4,sansa stark,"But I, I wouldn't… Wardeness of the North"
Episode 4,petyr baelish,You are the last surviving Stark. He needs you.
Episode 4,sansa stark,"What if you're wrong? What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell, or he does and the Boltons defeat him?"
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours."
Episode 4,sansa stark,I don't know how to do that.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,Of course you do. He's already fallen for you.
Episode 4,sansa stark,His father frightens me.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"He should, he's a dangerous man. But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered. And you've learnt to maneuver from the very best. . I return before too long. . You'll be strong without me. . The North will be yours. Do you believe me?"
Episode 4,sansa stark,I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return.
Episode 4,bronn,Breakfast.
Episode 4,bronn,That would have been a shit way to die.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die."
Episode 4,bronn,Aye. But your lot like to give the singers a good ending.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.
Episode 4,bronn,"No? Two knights, off to rescue a princess. Sounds like a good song to me."
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Sounds like all the rest.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,What about you? What shit way would you choose?
Episode 4,bronn,"In my own keep, drinking my own wine, watching my sons grovel for my fortune."
Episode 4,jaime lannister,How disappointing. I thought you'd have something more exciting planned.
Episode 4,bronn,I've had an exciting life. I want my death to be boring. How do you want to go?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,In the arms of the woman I love.
Episode 4,bronn,She want the same thing?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Let's go.
Episode 4,bronn,"The captain to that ship… What was he, Braavosi?"
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Pentoshi.
Episode 4,bronn,And he's headed to Oldtown?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,As I said. Why?
Episode 4,bronn,What's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister's in Dorne?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,A bag of gold.
Episode 4,bronn,I'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,It was a heavy bag.
Episode 4,bronn,And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it. But you won't be around if he breaks them.
Episode 4,bronn,How many you count?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Four.
Episode 4,bronn,How many you think you can take?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"One, if he's slow."
Episode 4,bronn,"Fucked in the arse. . Hiya! . Morning, lads. Glad we found you."
Episode 4,bronn,Cooper. . This is Darnell.
Episode 4,bronn,Accent gave me away? Flea Bottom. Whelped and whipped.
Episode 4,bronn,"Our ship capsized in the night. We managed to swim ashore. It was a near thing, really."
Episode 4,jaime lannister,I thought the sharks would get us. .
Episode 4,jaime lannister,I could have sworn those were shark fins.
Episode 4,bronn,Dolphins maybe.
Episode 4,bronn,"Boys, there's no need for this. Just, point us in the right direction. We'll find our way home."
Episode 4,bronn,That one should be slow enough.
Episode 4,bronn,Nice move! .
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Luck.
Episode 4,bronn,You had a wonderful teacher.
Episode 4,bronn,Always wanted a Dornish stallion. Beasts can run a day and night without tiring. We'll ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,First we need to bury these bodies.
Episode 4,bronn,Birds have to eat too.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"Corpses raise questions, questions raise armies. We're not here to start a war."
Episode 4,bronn,Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"I can't dig very well with one hand. Not at all, really."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,Thank you. . Who are you?
Episode 4,jorah mormont,Your captor.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,Do you have wine?
Episode 4,jorah mormont,No.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,I can't sleep without wine.
Episode 4,jorah mormont,Then stay awake.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,You're going the wrong way. My sister's in Westeros. Westeros is west! We're heading east.
Episode 4,jorah mormont,I'm not taking you to your sister.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,You said you were taking me to the Queen.
Episode 4,jorah mormont,I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen. She's the Queen I serve.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,What a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself!
Episode 4,jorah mormont,What business would you have with the Queen?
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand. So now that it's clear we're on the same side? . A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. . And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely."
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Everyone looks happy enough from up here. . What?
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Why?
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,He sang to them?
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,And what did you do?
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,He was good?
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. .
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,And what did you do with the money?
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,How many others are there?
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan?"
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"I think I can protect me from Hizdahr Zo Loraq. Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me."
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,I do not recognize this tradition.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"Barristan the Bold"" they called him. He crossed a continent to serve me. He was a loyal friend. And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,I prefer your earlier suggestion. Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,Walk forward.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,Another step.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"They will eat you, if I tell them to. They may eat you even if I don't. Children. Some say I should give up on them. . But a good mother never gives up on her children. She disciplines them if she must."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,But she does not give up on them.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"Who is innocent? Maybe all of you are, , maybe none of you are. Maybe, , I should let the dragons decide."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,Don't want to overfeed them. Tomorrow perhaps.
Episode 5,sam,"And though Daenerys maintains her grip on Slaver's Bay, forces rise against her from within and without. She refuses to leave until the freedom of the former slaves is secure."" She sounds like quite a woman."
Episode 5,sam,"Don't say that, Maester Aemon."
Episode 5,jon snow,Maester Aemon.
Episode 5,jon snow,"Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone."
Episode 5,jon snow,How are you feeling?
Episode 5,jon snow,"I need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order."
Episode 5,jon snow,But you don't know what it is.
Episode 5,jon snow,Where are the rest of the free folk now? . Where have they gone? . Who leads them?
Episode 5,jon snow,What about you?
Episode 5,jon snow,What if I unchained you?
Episode 5,jon snow,Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.
Episode 5,jon snow,"For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you."
Episode 5,jon snow,It is.
Episode 5,jon snow,"Because now, , I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch."
Episode 5,jon snow,I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.
Episode 5,jon snow,I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.
Episode 5,jon snow,"And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward."
Episode 5,jon snow,Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people.
Episode 5,jon snow,Up on Storroldo s Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week.
Episode 5,jon snow,I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.
Episode 5,jon snow,"Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing."
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,Fewer.
Episode 5,davos,What?
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,Nothing.
Episode 5,sam,There is good farmland in the Gift. . Land that no one uses now. A dozen abandoned villages.
Episode 5,jon snow,And we've slaughtered theirs.
Episode 5,jon snow,"You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that."
Episode 5,jon snow,"Thank you. . Olly. . If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right."
Episode 5,jon snow,It's not a trick.
Episode 5,jon snow,I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone.
Episode 5,jon snow,No.
Episode 5,brienne,Better off with the Boltons who murdered her mother and brother? Sansa's in danger even if she doesn't realize it.
Episode 5,brienne,Thank you. You've lived here a long time?
Episode 5,brienne,Did you know Lord Eddard?
Episode 5,brienne,Not all of them. I know who's inside that castle.
Episode 5,brienne,I'm not talking about the Boltons. I need to get a message to her. To Sansa Stark.
Episode 5,brienne,Someone who swore to keep her safe.
Episode 5,brienne,Her mother.
Episode 5,brienne,That doesn't release me from an oath. I served Lady Catelyn. I serve her still. Who do you serve?
Episode 5,sansa stark,"Oh, I don't need-"
Episode 5,sansa stark,But who -
Episode 5,sansa stark,I made it myself.
Episode 5,sansa stark,"Who, who are you?"
Episode 5,sansa stark,My mother. .
Episode 5,sansa stark,Thank you.
Episode 5,sansa stark,I'd rather have a mother.
Episode 5,sansa stark,What is it?
Episode 5,sansa stark,Theon?
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,You shouldn't be here.
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,"No, my lord."
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,She saw me.
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,Sansa. Lady Sansa. She came to the kennels.
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,"Yes. I'm sorry, master. Forgive me. I didn't think -"
Episode 5,sansa stark,"Yes, thank you, my lord."
Episode 5,sansa stark,This isn't a strange place. This is my home. It's the people who are strange.
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,"Yes, master."
Episode 5,sansa stark,Why are you doing this?
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,I'm sorry.
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,For killing your brothers.
Episode 5,sansa stark,I'm very happy for you.
Episode 5,sam,Every book there is?
Episode 5,sam,"Well, no. There are thousands and thousands of books out there. This library is rather small, actually."
Episode 5,sam,My father's not the most literate man. They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world.
Episode 5,sam,The Citadel? In Oldtown.
Episode 5,sam,"Gilly, look at me. You know how to do a hundred things I can never do. You can build a fire with wet wood. You can cook. You can stitch a wound."
Episode 5,sam,Well -
Episode 5,sam,It's where they train the maesters.
Episode 5,sam,"I wanted to be one when I was young. Instead, I became a man of the Night's Watch. Far more adventure up here anyway. I wouldn't have met you."
Episode 5,sam,"Ah, Your Grace."
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,You're Samwell Tarly?
Episode 5,sam,"I am, Your Grace."
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,"Your father is Randyll Tarly. He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford. Only battle Robert ever lost. I told him he shouldn't go so far west so soon, but he never listened. Fine soldier, your father. You don't look like a soldier. But I'm told you killed a white walker."
Episode 5,sam,"I did, Your Grace."
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,How?
Episode 5,sam,With a dagger made of dragonglass.
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,Dragonglass?
Episode 5,sam,What the maesters call obsidian -
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone. Why would obsidian kill a walker?
Episode 5,sam,"I don't know. I've been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something, and all I've learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass."
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall.
Episode 5,sam,"I've seen it, Your Grace."
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,Seen what?
Episode 5,sam,The army of the dead. And when they come -
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,"We have to know how to fight them. . Keep reading, Samwell Tarly."
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,It's time.
Episode 5,davos,"Uh, Your Grace. Wouldn't it be better to wait? When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings, we could have thousands more men."
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,"If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings. We can't wait that long. We have the advantage, more men, more horses, all fed and rested. But every day we wait, the odds shift in Bolton's favor. This could turn to winter at any moment. We have to act now. Give the order. We march at sunrise."
Episode 5,davos,I'll choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess.
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,"No need, they're coming with us."
Episode 5,davos,"It's a tough road ahead, Your Grace. Won't they be safer -"
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,"Here? Half these watchmen are killers and rapists. No, they march with us."
Episode 5,davos,"As you wish, Your Grace."
Episode 5,davos,Beg your pardon?
Episode 5,davos,First things first. It's a long march ahead. And then we have to take the castle.
Episode 5,davos,"Aye, princess, but you won't be anywhere near -"
Episode 5,davos,"Yes, my queen."
Episode 5,davos,"Well, I am. When the battle comes, promise you'll protect me."
Episode 5,stannis baratheon,I hope you know what you're doing with these wildlings. I need those ships.
Episode 5,jon snow,"You'll get them back, I swear it. Have a safe journey, Your Grace. And thank you."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"If I give everyone what they deserve, I'll have no one left to rule. Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died. Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself. What do you think?"
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,You are as fit as anyone I know. You know why I'm here. And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart. So what do you think?
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"What about ""Valar Morghulis""?"
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"It takes courage to admit fear. And to admit a mistake. I came here to tell you that I was wrong. I was wrong and you were right. About tradition. About bringing the people of this city together. I will reopen the fighting pits. To free men only. Slavery will never return to Meereen, not while I live."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people, I will marry the leader of an ancient family. . Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"Don't worry. I'll be fine. Nothing broken, I don't think. Where are we now? Not the Rhoyne. . Long, sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face. The Mormont way. Let's start over. I apologize for before. My mouth sometimes runs away from me. This doesn't have to be an unpleasant trip. We're going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen."
Episode 5,jorah mormont,We are.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,No wine.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"I am a person who drinks. People who drink need to keep drinking. Otherwise, they're not…"
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,I know where we are. You're taking us through Valyria.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,I am.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Have you sailed this route before?
Episode 5,jorah mormont,No.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,You're going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case I'm not enough?
Episode 5,jorah mormont,I think you'll be plenty.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,You know what they say. The Doom still rules Valyria. What about the demons and the flames? Aren't you afraid of the Doom?
Episode 5,jorah mormont,No. But the pirates are.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Oh.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,The Smoking Sea. How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again? Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything. And then -
Episode 5,jorah mormont,And then they weren't.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"And then they weren't. ""They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end. The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned -"""
Episode 5,jorah mormont,"The city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned; The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,I would clap.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"I suppose this is it, then. This is what remains."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,What was that?
Episode 5,jorah mormont,Stone Men! Don't let them touch you!
Episode 5,jorah mormont,Get behind!
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"Mormont, cut me free! . Mormont!"
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Mormont! Mormont!
Episode 5,jorah mormont,Tyrion? Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion. You're all right.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,You're heavier than you look. Did any of them touch you?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"You? . I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that."
Episode 5,jorah mormont,I suppose that's why they send them there.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. . Thank you for saving me. Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place. . So what now?"
Episode 5,jorah mormont,"We walk, up the coast. With luck, we'll find a fishing village. Maybe another boat."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Without luck?
Episode 5,jorah mormont,"We've got a long walk ahead of us. I'll get some wood for a fire. Try to get some rest, huh?"
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,That's the best idea you've had all day.
Episode 6,arya stark,What are they doing with the bodies?
Episode 6,arya stark,No! I've been here for weeks. I'm not scrubbing one more corpse until you tell me why I'm doing it.
Episode 6,arya stark,When?
Episode 6,arya stark,When do I get to play the game?
Episode 6,arya stark,The game. The game of faces.
Episode 6,arya stark,I didn't even know I was playing.
Episode 6,arya stark,No one.
Episode 6,arya stark,Well who are you? What are you doing here? How'd you get here?
Episode 6,arya stark,What?
Episode 6,arya stark,Arya.
Episode 6,arya stark,Westeros. My family home is Winterfell. I'm the youngest daughter of a great lord. Eddard Stark. He died in battle.
Episode 6,arya stark,After he was executed I fled the capital. Had to kill a stable boy. Drove my sword through his back.
Episode 6,arya stark,I stabbed him in the gut. I tried to find my mother and brother. I never did. They were murdered by Walder Frey. An outlaw kidnapped me. A man called Polliver.
Episode 6,arya stark,"A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane. He tried to sell me but was wounded in a fight. He begged me to kill him but I wouldn't. I left him in the mountains to die. I wanted him to suffer, I hated him."
Episode 6,arya stark,I hated him.
Episode 6,arya stark,I hated him!
Episode 6,arya stark,That's not a lie!
Episode 6,arya stark,Yes.
Episode 6,arya stark,I'm not playing this stupid game anymore!
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"So, those villages we were supposed to find. We can't live on berries and roots."
Episode 6,jorah mormont,I can.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,You're not hungry?
Episode 6,jorah mormont,Of course I'm hungry.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"You're an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met."
Episode 6,jorah mormont,I am not your travelling companion.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,We are travelling together. In each other's company. Therefore…
Episode 6,jorah mormont,Do you ever shut up?
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,Why?
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,I'm sure you've visited many brothels in many cities.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn't commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man."
Episode 6,jorah mormont,What do you know about my father?
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? “We shall never see his like again.”"
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,You didn't know. I'm sorry. I am.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,How?
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,I only know what I heard
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,He was leading an expedition beyond the wall. There was a mutiny. He was murdered by his own men.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,We better keep moving.
Episode 6,arya stark,Valar dohaeris.
Episode 6,arya stark,"I know. Don't be afraid. I used to be like you. I was sick. I was dying. But my father never gave up on me. He loved me. More than anything in the world, just like your father loves you. So he brought me here. My father prayed to the many faced god. And I drank the water from this fountain. It healed me."
Episode 6,arya stark,I've devoted my life to him now. You don't want to hurt anymore. Drink.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert's Rebellion."
Episode 6,jorah mormont,Do you believe in anything?
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,I believe in many things.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,"In something greater than ourselves, I mean. The Gods. Destiny. Do you believe there's a plan for this world?"
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,No.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,"Neither did I. I was a cynic, just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought I'd find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?"
Episode 6,jorah mormont,It's hard to be a cynic after that.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Doesn't mean she's going to be a great queen.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,No it doesn't.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?"
Episode 6,jorah mormont,First we have to conquer the world.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"We? Alright, let's assume your dreams come true. She's ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?"
Episode 6,jorah mormont,Then she rules.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That's justice?
Episode 6,jorah mormont,She is the rightful heir.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?"
Episode 6,jorah mormont,Shh! It's a slave ship
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Why is it anchored?
Episode 6,jorah mormont,They probably came ashore for--
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let's discuss this!"
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can't just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?"
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Guess again.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"The fighting puts in Mereen! You're in luck then, you're about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Him.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!"
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,The Kingslayer!
Episode 6,jorah mormont,I killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,"It's no lie. His name was Qotho. He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo. Take me to Slaver's Bay, put a sword in my hand, I'll prove my worth."
Episode 6,petyr baelish,Yes? Lancel Lannister.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,That's quite a family to abandon.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,Well done.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,I'm here on urgent business for the Queen Mother. Should I send word that I'll be delayed?
Episode 6,petyr baelish,"We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel. Mine just happen to be entertaining."
Episode 6,petyr baelish,"Do you think it's wise, your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden?"
Episode 6,cersei lannister,The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,Of course. And the Faith were armed on your orders.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,The King's orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras' perversion?
Episode 6,petyr baelish,House Tyrell won't tolerate these insults.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,"House Tyrell won't tolerate it? I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys."
Episode 6,petyr baelish,One's choice of companion is a curious thing.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you're still in mourning.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,"She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him."
Episode 6,petyr baelish,I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?
Episode 6,petyr baelish,Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,Good. If there's nothing else.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,"There is another matter, your Grace. Something so urgent I couldn't trust the words to a raven. You once charged me with finding Arya Stark. To my shame I failed you. But I have found Sansa Stark. Alive, and well, and home again. In Winterfell."
Episode 6,cersei lannister,That's not possible.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,"My sources are well placed. They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen."
Episode 6,cersei lannister,Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,Indeed. As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,We were fools to trust a turncloak.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,"I would counsel patience, your grace."
Episode 6,cersei lannister,"Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor."
Episode 6,petyr baelish,"Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they're done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives."
Episode 6,cersei lannister,"Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn."
Episode 6,petyr baelish,"That is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds. Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force."
Episode 6,cersei lannister,My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,"Ser Jaime, then."
Episode 6,cersei lannister,Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. I've no idea when he'll be back.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,"Perhaps I can help. The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow."
Episode 6,cersei lannister,"Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man."
Episode 6,petyr baelish,"You wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury. What do you have to lose, a brothel keeper?"
Episode 6,cersei lannister,And if you succeed?
Episode 6,petyr baelish,Name me Warden of the North.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,I'll speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,I'll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,And I'll l know you're a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike.
Episode 6,petyr baelish,As I said. I live to serve.
Episode 6,bronn,The Dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring. The Dornishman's blade it was made of black steel and its kiss was a terrible thing. The Dornishman's wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach...
Episode 6,jaime lannister,"Alright, thats enough."
Episode 6,bronn,I'm coming to the best part.
Episode 6,jaime lannister,We're trying to blend in. We don't want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent.
Episode 6,bronn,This song really is all about the ending.
Episode 6,jaime lannister,It can wait. Up there.
Episode 6,jaime lannister,That's the Water Gardens.
Episode 6,bronn,"Once we got the princess, then what?"
Episode 6,jaime lannister,I like to improvise.
Episode 6,bronn,That explains the golden hand.
Episode 6,bronn,"Well, she's made herself at home."
Episode 6,jaime lannister,Myrcella.
Episode 6,jaime lannister,Let's speak in private.
Episode 6,jaime lannister,Excellent. Good to meet you.
Episode 6,bronn,"Why don't you let them have some time alone, son?"
Episode 6,bronn,Let's not do something stupid.
Episode 6,bronn,That was something stupid.
Episode 6,jaime lannister,"We have to go, Myrcella, now."
Episode 6,jaime lannister,"You'll be fine, I promise, but we have to--"
Episode 6,bronn,Oh for fuck's sake.
Episode 6,bronn,You fight pretty good for a little girl.
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,"Oh! You can smell the shit from 5 miles away. Well, why are we stopped, go on."
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,"Rumors and gossip, that's all they got. It's theater, nothing more. If they arrested all the pillow biters in King's Landing there'd be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else."
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone knew. No one cared.
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,"And Loras is the queen's brother. No, no, no, no, this is unacceptable."
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,"Of course she is. She wants to drag our names through the dirt. Put us in our place. Get some rest, dear, you look appalling. Let me deal with Cersei Lannister."
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,"Your Grace, I have travelled a long way."
Episode 6,cersei lannister,You must be exhausted.
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,"Put the pen down, dear, we all know you aren't writing anything."
Episode 6,cersei lannister,"Ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns."
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,And the famous tart Queen Cersei.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,Beg your pardon.
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,I know you're behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,If you apologize for that comment perhaps--
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,You'll get your apology when I get Loras.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,"Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?"
Episode 6,cersei lannister,I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains--
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,Do you expect the alliance to continue after you've thrown our future into prison?
Episode 6,cersei lannister,"As I said, i didn't imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats--"
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,What veil?
Episode 6,cersei lannister,The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,I didn't trust your father. I didn't particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,"House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I'm sure they don't. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we'll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna."
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,Well I think that's quite enough of that.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,This testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,What are you doing? Let us pass.
Episode 6,sansa stark,What do you want?
Episode 6,sansa stark,What others?
Episode 6,sansa stark,Hunt?
Episode 6,sansa stark,What was your name again?
Episode 6,sansa stark,"And how long have you loved him, Myranda. Did you imagine that he would be with you forever, is that it? Then I came along and ruined it. I am Sansa Stark of Winterfell. This is my home and you can't frighten me."
Episode 6,sansa stark,Go. I can finish on my own.
Episode 6,sansa stark,Yes?
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"I've come to escort you to the Godswood, my lady. If you please, my lady, will you take my arm?"
Episode 6,sansa stark,No.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"Lord Ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm."
Episode 6,sansa stark,I'm not touching you.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,Please. He'll punish me.
Episode 6,sansa stark,Do you think I care what he does to you.
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,"Sansa of the House Stark comes here to be wed. A woman grown, trueborn and noble. She comes to beg the blessings of the gods. Who comes to claim her?"
Episode 6,theon greyjoy,Theon of House Greyjoy. Who was… who was her father's ward.
Episode 6,sansa stark,I take this man.
Episode 6,sansa stark,Yes.
Episode 6,sansa stark,"Lord Tyrion was kind, he was gentle, he never touched me."
Episode 6,sansa stark,"No, my lord."
Episode 6,sansa stark,Yes sir.
Episode 7,jon snow,"First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black."
Episode 7,jon snow,"As always, thank you for your honesty."
Episode 7,sam,"Safe travels, Lord Commander."
Episode 7,jon snow,"Thank you, Sam."
Episode 7,sam,"Oh, and…"
Episode 7,sam,It's Dragonglass. It's what I used to kill the White Walker. I hope you don't need them.
Episode 7,jon snow,Me too.
Episode 7,sam,"His little brother, Aegon. He became king."
Episode 7,sansa stark,"Theon, wait."
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,"Not Theon, my lady. Reek."
Episode 7,sansa stark,Help me.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,You're his wife now.
Episode 7,sansa stark,Theon
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,Do what he says. Do what he says or he'll hurt you.
Episode 7,sansa stark,He already hurts me every night. All day I'm locked in this room and every night he comes. It can't be worse.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,It can. It can always be worse.
Episode 7,sansa stark,What did he do to you?
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,Please…
Episode 7,sansa stark,You betrayed my family!
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
Episode 7,sansa stark,You have to help me!
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,He'll see us. You don't know him.
Episode 7,sansa stark,"My family still has friends in the North. All I have to do is give a signal and they'll rescue me. Climb to the top of the Broken Tower, light this candle, and put it in the window. Promise me, Theon."
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,"Reek, my lady, Reek!"
Episode 7,sansa stark,"Your name is Theon Greyjoy. Last surviving son of Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands, do you hear me? Theon. Promise me."
Episode 7,sam,You don't know that.
Episode 7,sam,I'll stay too. He's always been good to me. I can't leave him now.
Episode 7,sam,"His name was Aemon Targaryen. He came to us from King's Landing, a Maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn. And a sworn brother of the Night's Watch, ever faithful. No man was wiser or gentler or kinder. At the Wall a dozen Lord Commanders came and went during his years of service, but he was always there to counsel them. He was the blood of the dragon, but now his fire has gone out. And now his watch has ended."
Episode 7,sansa stark,But isn't your step mother pregnant?
Episode 7,sansa stark,What happens if she has a boy?
Episode 7,sansa stark,But he'll be the heir.
Episode 7,sansa stark,"But you're a bastard, a true born will always have the stronger claim."
Episode 7,sansa stark,Tommen Baratheon. Another bastard.
Episode 7,davos,40 horses died in the night. We'll lose more come sunset. We're running out of food. We can't open the supply line until the snow clears.
Episode 7,stannis baratheon,What else?
Episode 7,davos,The Stormcrows rode off last night.
Episode 7,stannis baratheon,500 men.
Episode 7,stannis baratheon,"Sell swords, loyal to nothing but gold."
Episode 7,davos,We still have a hard march to Wintefell and we won't be marching anywhere in this weather.
Episode 7,stannis baratheon,And?
Episode 7,davos,"This isn't our time, we should head back to Castle Black when the snow clears."
Episode 7,stannis baratheon,"I retreated from King's Landing, Ser Davos. If I retreat again, I become “The King Who Ran.”"
Episode 7,davos,Your Grace..
Episode 7,stannis baratheon,"Winter is coming. Those arent just the Stark words, it's a fact. If we march back to Castle Black, we winter at Castle Black. And who can say how many years this winter will last."
Episode 7,davos,It's better to wait for the right time than to risk everything.
Episode 7,stannis baratheon,"This is the right time, and I will risk everything. Because if I don't, we've lost. We march to victory or we march to defeat, but we go forward only forward,"
Episode 7,davos,Your Grace.
Episode 7,stannis baratheon,"I've trusted in your visions, in your prophecies for years."
Episode 7,stannis baratheon,I don't know what I saw.
Episode 7,stannis baratheon,"And you, do you trust yourself?"
Episode 7,stannis baratheon,Are you sure?
Episode 7,stannis baratheon,We don't have Robert's bastard here.
Episode 7,stannis baratheon,Have you lost your mind?
Episode 7,stannis baratheon,There must be another way. Leeches or something.
Episode 7,stannis baratheon,She's my daughter.
Episode 7,stannis baratheon,Get out.
Episode 7,sam,Get your hands off her. Brother Derryk. Brother Brand. I believe you both have guard duty tonight.
Episode 7,sam,"Gilly go on, Get back to your room and lock the door."
Episode 7,sam,I'm warning you.
Episode 7,sam,I said get your hands off her.
Episode 7,sam,I killed a White Walker. I killed a Thenn. I'll take my chances with you.
Episode 7,sam,I'm alright.
Episode 7,sam,I will not. They wouldo ve… I don't know what they would have done
Episode 7,sam,No. They were tiring out. I had them in the palm of my hand.
Episode 7,sam,What kind of man would I be if I ran away when I saw someone hurting you?
Episode 7,sam,"Of course I will. And I'll take care of you, too."
Episode 7,sam,Stay. Please.
Episode 7,sam,Oh. Oh my.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,Wait! You have to buy me as well.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"We're a team. I'm a great fighter, too."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,Thank you my Lord. Thank you.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"My Lord, if I may. I've heard Mereen's become a free city. You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits. Now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage…"
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Don't be ridiculous. My marriage to Hizdahr is political. I think he's smart enough to understand that.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Are you jealous?
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,I do.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"You told me yourself, I can't fight enemies within and without. So when enemies from without come knocking, I need the city of Mereen behind me. I have no choice."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,So what else can I do?
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"Even if I wanted to do such an inadviseable thing, I couldn't."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,No. I can't
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Of course
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,I am a queen. Not a butcher.
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,"You there! Where would I find the High Septon, or High Sparrow, or whatever bloody fool name he's got."
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,You should have the decency to stand when you talk to a lady.
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,Don't spar with me little fellow.
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,Hips.
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,"A man of the people, is that your game? It's an old game. dull and unconvincing. A man of the people who does Cersei's dirty work for her."
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,"Spare me the homilies, I can smell a fraud from a mile away."
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,I'm here for my grandson and granddaughter.
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,Don't you walk away from me.
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,What is it you want? Gold? I'll make you the richest septon who ever lived.
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,What then?
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,How do they communicate their demands? By raven or horse?
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,I've read the seven pointed star.
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,"Half the men, women, and children in this foul city break the sacred laws. You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists. And yet you punish Loras for shagging and Margaery for defending her brother?"
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,"If it's equality you want then so be it. When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital, everyone here will starve. And I'll make sure the hungry know who to blame,"
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"Starving yourself won't make things any better for her, my love."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"No matter who you are, no matter how strong you are, sooner or later, you'll face circumstances beyond your control."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,You know as well as I do who the first casualty in that war would be.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,We must be strong for those we love. We cannot give in to despair.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Let me speak to him on your behalf. The king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Your happiness is all I want in this world
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"No you don't. You can't possibly. Not until you have children of your own. I would do anything for you. Anything to keep you from harm. I would burn cities to the ground. That is all that matters. You and your sister. From the moment you came into this world, my boy. My only boy."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,And more hands. How's Trystane?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,I'm sorry for that. It wasn't supposed to happen that way.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Your mother's worried about you. Threats have been made. Dorne is too dangerous for you. I've come to take you home.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,It's for your own good. These are complicated matters.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,I don't understand.
Episode 7,bronn,"Brothers oh brothers, my days here are done, the Dornishman's taken my life. Bur what does it matter, for all men must die, and I've tasted the Dornishman's wife! Yes I've tasted the Dornishman's wife!"
Episode 7,bronn,It's against my code to hurt a woman.
Episode 7,bronn,I wouldn't say you beat me.
Episode 7,bronn,Wonderful. Wouldn't feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar.
Episode 7,bronn,No great hurry. Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world.
Episode 7,bronn,I said Dornish women. I didn't say you.
Episode 7,bronn,I've seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms.
Episode 7,bronn,"Well now, in King's Landing there was an absolutely gorgeous..."
Episode 7,bronn,Was I?
Episode 7,bronn,Was there? My memory's not what it was earlier.
Episode 7,bronn,You seem concerned with it. You must really like me.
Episode 7,bronn,My head… You don't even wanna know what's going on in…
Episode 7,bronn,It's nothing. It's the dry air.
Episode 7,bronn,You.
Episode 7,petyr baelish,I'm sorry about the locale.
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,No you're not.
Episode 7,petyr baelish,It felt like the safest place.
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,"Not for your clientele, clearly."
Episode 7,petyr baelish,"It was an establishment like no other. The sheer range of appetites catered to, desires that didn't exist until we invented them."
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,"You've always been rather impressed with yourself, haven't you?"
Episode 7,petyr baelish,The past is the past. The future is all that's worth discussing. The future of House Tyrell.
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,"Don't pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren, or me. I should have known you'd return to the capital once things started going wrong."
Episode 7,petyr baelish,I promise you..
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,"I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined. Together we murdered a king. And if my house should fall, I would have nothing to hide. And if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market, they'll never even find what's left of you. So do you deny a part in all of this?"
Episode 7,petyr baelish,Cersei summoned me to King's Landing. I dared not refuse her.
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,And what did she want?
Episode 7,petyr baelish,"A piece of info that she know that I had. Neither silence nor lies were an option. But I have other information of which she is unaware. And as you say, our interests are aligned. I have a gift for you."
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,What kind of gift?
Episode 7,petyr baelish,The same kind I gave Cersei. A handsome young man.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Sitting through the great games will be bad enough.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,I think I've seen enough.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,I've sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,What are you doing?
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Get him out of my sight.
Episode 7,jorah mormont,"Khaleesi, please, I just need a moment of your time. I brought you a gift."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,It's true. He has.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Who are you?
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"I am the gift. It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. It's quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,You're upset. You're not thinking clearly. I'll visit again when you've had a chance to calm down.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"I do hope you change your mind about that. I've been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"Yes, I'm afraid I must. My son needs me now more than ever."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"Sleep well, sister."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Yes.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now?
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Who will stand judge?
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Will you be one of them?
Episode 7,cersei lannister,If one or both of them were to confess before the trial…
Episode 7,cersei lannister,What does The Mother's mercy entail?
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,I think I may have heard at one point.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,I'm afraid i don't.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Move. Let me go immediately.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy… I am the queen! Let me go!
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Look at me. Look at my face. It's the last thing you'll see before you die.
Episode 8,jorah mormont,"Your Grace, I want to say--"
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,If only I were otherwise.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn't I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It's too soon to know if you deserve my service.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,If you'd rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least."
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,I have a very large army and very large dragons.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Killing and politics aren't always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,So you want to advise me. Very well. What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,I know.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Why should the people trust a queen who can't keep her promises?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can't remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, many opportunities."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,And did he?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,No. Not until forced to do so.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him."
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,So I should kill him?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you're going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you're ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do."
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Remove Ser Jorah from the city.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,My son. Let me speak to--
Episode 8,cersei lannister,My face will be the last thing you see before--
Episode 8,arya stark,"My name is Lana. I'm an orphan. When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters, and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more."
Episode 8,arya stark,"Iit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart. Now every morning I make my way down to the canals. I pass the fish mongers and the bakers. I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on my way home. Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--"
Episode 8,arya stark,"Left onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade."
Episode 8,arya stark,How will she serve him?
Episode 8,arya stark,What will she do there?
Episode 8,arya stark,See what?
Episode 8,arya stark,"Oysters, clams and cockles!"
Episode 8,arya stark,Oysters clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles!
Episode 8,arya stark,Best in the city.
Episode 8,arya stark,So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?
Episode 8,arya stark,"If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money."
Episode 8,arya stark,The Many Faced God. You said you didn't know what I would see at the docks.
Episode 8,arya stark,And then what?
Episode 8,cersei lannister,The charges?
Episode 8,cersei lannister,All lies.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,I wish you'd said it sooner. Any word from Jaime?
Episode 8,cersei lannister,Tell him I need to speak to him.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king--"
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother."
Episode 8,cersei lannister,I can't stay here.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"Confess? To the High Sparrow? I won't. I made him. I rose him up from nothing, I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness."
Episode 8,sansa stark,Why. Why Theon.
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,Not Theon. There is no Theon. Reek.
Episode 8,sansa stark,"Reek. Why did you tell him, Reek?"
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,"I was helping you. You were trying to escape, there is no escape. Not ever. Theon Greyjoy tried to escape. The master knew. He knows everything. He hunted him, he caught him, he strapped him to a cross, and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left."
Episode 8,sansa stark,"Good. If it weren't for you I'd still have a family. If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would."
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,I deserved everything. I deserve to be Reek. I did terrible things. Turned on Robb. Captured Winterfell. Killed those boys.
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,"They weren't “those boys”, they were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers, you'd know them since they were born."
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,They weren't. They were only--
Episode 8,sansa stark,Only what?
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,I can't..
Episode 8,sansa stark,Tell me!
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,"I can't, not unless the master says..."
Episode 8,sansa stark,"Tell me, they weren't what?!"
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,They weren't...
Episode 8,sansa stark,"Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be dead while you still breathe the air. Tell me to my face Theon, tell me that they weren't your brothers!"
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,They weren't Bran and Rickon! I couldn't find them. It was two farm boys. I killed them and burned them so no one would know.
Episode 8,sansa stark,You didn't…?
Episode 8,sansa stark,"Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?"
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,I can't talk to you anymore.
Episode 8,sansa stark,"Theon, you have to tell me, do you have any idea where Bran and Rickon--"
Episode 8,theon greyjoy,"Not Theon, Reek!"
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,So have you decided yet? Whether I'm worthy of your service?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Have you decided yet whether you're going to have me killed?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,It's probably my safest option.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,I can see why you would think so. It's what your father would have done.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,And what would your father do?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Is that why you killed him?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Some day if you decide not to execute me, I'll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we'll need more wine than this."
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers."
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,I'm terrible?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,I've heard stories.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,To see if you were the right kind of terrible.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Which kind is that?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed."
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Perhaps it won't come to that.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,It's not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Varys? King Robert's spy master?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn't have to do. I suspect he's the main reason you weren't slaughtered in your crib.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,But you trust him?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother."
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,The brother who killed my father.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,That's the one.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,Perhaps I will have you killed after all.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting."
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,I'm not going to kill you.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,No? Banish me?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,No.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"So if I'm not going to be murdered, and I'm not going to be banished..."
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,You're going to advise me. While you can still speak in complete sentences.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Advise you on what?
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,How to get what I want.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,If I want jokes I'll get myself a proper fool.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,I'm not entirely joking. There's more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,I fought so that no child born into Slaver's Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"And when you get back to your home, who supports you?"
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,The common people.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Let's be generous and assume that's going to happen. Here in Slaver's Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won't back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won't back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough."
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,"Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They're all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,It's a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You're not the first person to have dreamt it.
Episode 8,daenerys targaryen,I'm not going to stop the wheel. I'm going to break the wheel.
Episode 8,jorah mormont,You said whoever wins would fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen. I won.
Episode 8,jorah mormont,I've been flogged if it makes you happy. I'm the best you've got. If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for?
Episode 8,jorah mormont,Let me fight for her and I belong to you.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"I'll get out of here, you realize. Before long."
Episode 8,cersei lannister,I can make you a wealthy woman. A lady of the court.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable, and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die."
Episode 8,sam,No.
Episode 8,sam,How are you?
Episode 8,sam,You know what I mean.
Episode 8,sam,Are you scared?
Episode 8,sam,Me too.
Episode 8,sam,Who's there?
Episode 8,sam,Come in.
Episode 8,sam,Not to worry. Men brawl from time to time. It's only natural.
Episode 8,sam,You're a good lad.
Episode 8,sam,Now then. How can I help?
Episode 8,sam,Yes?
Episode 8,sam,We've been fighting them for years.
Episode 8,sam,"Wildlings are people, just like us. There are good ones and bad ones."
Episode 8,sam,Olly...
Episode 8,sam,"I've seen the army of the dead. I've seen the white walkers, and they're coming for us, for all the living. And when it's time we'll need every last man we can find."
Episode 8,sam,"Jon's taking a risk, but he has to. We don't stand a chance otherwise. Sometimes a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run."
Episode 8,sam,With all my heart.
Episode 8,sam,Try not to worry Olly. I've been worrying about Jon for years. He always comes back.
Episode 8,jon snow,Does that make me a fool?
Episode 8,jon snow,He's not my prisoner.
Episode 8,jon snow,We're allies.
Episode 8,jon snow,We're not here to fight. We're here to talk.
Episode 8,jon snow,My name's Jon Snow. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. We're not friends. We've never been friends. We won't become friends today. This isn't about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what's out there.
Episode 8,jon snow,In normal times we wouldn't. But these aren't normal times. The white walkers don't care if a man's Free Folk or Crow. We're all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.
Episode 8,jon snow,It's not a trick. It's a gift for those who join us.
Episode 8,jon snow,Dragonglass. A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.
Episode 8,jon snow,No. But I trust the man.
Episode 8,jon snow,Come with me and I'll share these weapons.
Episode 8,jon snow,There are good lands south of the wall. The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.
Episode 8,jon snow,"I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We're prepared to give you that new life."
Episode 8,jon snow,If you swear you join us when the real war begins.
Episode 8,jon snow,He died.
Episode 8,jon snow,I put an arrow through his heart.
Episode 8,jon snow,"I'm not asking you to forget your dead. I'll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I'm asking you to think about your children now. They'll never have children of their own if we don't band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can't stop them. The Night's Watch can't stop them. And all the southern kings can't stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we'll give the fuckers a fight."
Episode 8,jon snow,How many are with us? 5000?
Episode 8,jon snow,We're leaving too many behind.
Episode 8,jon snow,And he knew them better than I ever will.
Episode 8,jon snow,Get in line! Get in line!
Episode 8,jon snow,Hold the line! Hold the line!
Episode 8,jon snow,Get them to the ship and come back for me!
Episode 8,jon snow,Now!
Episode 8,jon snow,You should be on one of those boats.
Episode 8,jon snow,You have my word. I've given orders.
Episode 8,jon snow,Night's Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!
Episode 8,jon snow,The Dragonglass!
Episode 8,jon snow,Go! Go! Go!
Episode 8,jon snow,Let's go now! Now!
Episode 9,davos,"A band of 20 men, maybe less. They were in and out before anyone spotted them, burnt our food stores to the ground, all our siege weapons were destroyed, dozens of tents were--"
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,Horses?
Episode 9,davos,"We're still getting a count, but hundreds are dead."
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?
Episode 9,davos,The northerners know more about their land than we ever will.
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,"Put last night's guards in chains, either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy. Find out the truth and then hang them."
Episode 9,davos,"Unless there's a thaw, we can't press forward to Winterfell, and we don't have enough food to get us back to Castle Black."
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,We're not returning to Castle Black.
Episode 9,davos,"Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters. But if we can't march forward, and we won't march back…"
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,Have the dead horses butchered for meat.
Episode 9,jon snow,It was a failure.
Episode 9,sam,It wasn't.
Episode 9,jon snow,"I went to save them, I failed."
Episode 9,sam,"You didn't fail him, or him, or her. Every one of them is alive because of you, and no one else."
Episode 9,jon snow,I don't think that fact's lost on them.
Episode 9,davos,"You sent for me, Your Grace."
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,"Find you some healthy horses and a few good men to guard you, I'm sending you back to Castle Black. Tell the Lord Commander to send food, supplies, fresh horses, in return when I take the throne I'll make sure the Night's Watch has all the men it requires. He can guard all 19 castles if he so wishes."
Episode 9,davos,"Your Grace, you've named me your Hand."
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,Yes.
Episode 9,davos,"The King's Hand should never abandon the King, especially in a time of war."
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,"You're not abandoning me, you're obeying a command."
Episode 9,davos,A boy with a scroll could deliver this message.
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,"And if Jon Snow refuses a boy with a scroll, what does the boy say? I didn't name you hand for your expertise in military matters, ride for Castle Black, don't come back empty handed."
Episode 9,davos,"Your Grace, perhaps Queen and Princess Shireen could accompany me."
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,My family stays with me.
Episode 9,davos,At least let me take Shireen. A siege is no place for a little girl.
Episode 9,davos,What's this one now?
Episode 9,davos,Well that sounds like a proper story.
Episode 9,davos,"But the dragon only saw a dumb man, holding a mirrored shield."
Episode 9,davos,"Thus ending the dragonslaying career of Ser Byron Swann. I made you something, Princess."
Episode 9,davos,Do you like it?
Episode 9,davos,You're very welcome.
Episode 9,davos,Of course I will.
Episode 9,davos,"Because you deserve it. My son was always on me trying to teach me to read. Gods, I was stubborn about it. Made it this far without reading, seemed to me I could make it to the grave. I wish I had listened to them. This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up. I'll be gone for a few days, Princess. I'll want to hear all about the dance of dragons when I'm back."
Episode 9,jaime lannister,Prince Doran.
Episode 9,jaime lannister,Princess Myrcella.
Episode 9,jaime lannister,What a lovely dress.
Episode 9,jaime lannister,You must be cold.
Episode 9,jaime lannister,Prince Trystane. How's your jaw?
Episode 9,jaime lannister,"Looking out for the safety of my niece, the princess Myrcella."
Episode 9,jaime lannister,We received a threatening message. The princess's necklace in the jaws of a viper.
Episode 9,jaime lannister,Ah. Excellent. The last meal before the beheading.
Episode 9,jaime lannister,I'm afraid he does.
Episode 9,jaime lannister,I accept.
Episode 9,jaime lannister,You have my word.
Episode 9,jaime lannister,May I inquire into the fate of my man?
Episode 9,jaime lannister,He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished it's me.
Episode 9,jaime lannister,You're a good man.
Episode 9,bronn,Am I going to be happy at the end of this walk?
Episode 9,bronn,The most beautiful woman in the world.
Episode 9,jaime lannister,"Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater."
Episode 9,bronn,Only the one.
Episode 9,jaime lannister,I believe you've already met Prince Trystane.
Episode 9,bronn,Prince. Sorry about the other day.
Episode 9,jaime lannister,Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy. He's agreed to grant you your freedom.
Episode 9,bronn,I'm glad to hear it. The pie looks good.
Episode 9,jaime lannister,There was one condition.
Episode 9,arya stark,"Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cock--"
Episode 9,arya stark,"Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels!"
Episode 9,arya stark,Three coppers.
Episode 9,jon snow,Here's a silver because the lady likes you.
Episode 9,arya stark,The Thin Man wasn't hungry today.
Episode 9,arya stark,Tomorrow.
Episode 9,jaime lannister,Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.
Episode 9,jaime lannister,She will.
Episode 9,jaime lannister,"Of course, she's my niece."
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,No. What are you reading?
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,What's it about?
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,The dance of dragons”? Why is that a dance?
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,Doesn't make much sense.
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,"If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon, who would you have chosen?"
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,"Sometimes a person has to choose. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is not choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it."
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,You don't even know what I'm talking about.
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,Yes there is.
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,Forgive me.
Episode 9,stannis baratheon,There's no other way. She has King's blood.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,Where have you been?
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,The smaller man it is.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,I'm not putting my money anywhere.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,"Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you?"
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,There's always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,It's easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,That is greatness?
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,My father would have liked you.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,If need be.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,Someone else's reason.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Well said, you're an eloquent man. Doesn't mean you're wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles."
Episode 9,jorah mormont,"I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious Queen."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,You can end this.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,You can!
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Stay close!
Episode 9,jorah mormont,This way!
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,Drogon!
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,Valahd..
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,We ride for Winterfell.
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,Prepare to form up.
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,Tell me.
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,How many?
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,Speak up. It can't be worse than mutiny.
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,Cut her down.
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,Get the men into marching formation. On to Winterfell.
Episode 10,jon snow,"He raised his hands. And they all stood up at once. Tens of thousands of them, the biggest army in the world."
Episode 10,sam,So what are you gonna do?
Episode 10,jon snow,I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the wall.
Episode 10,sam,But… the Dragonglass?
Episode 10,jon snow,"No one's ever getting that back, now. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, unless we had a mountain of it."
Episode 10,sam,But… you killed a White Walker.
Episode 10,jon snow,With Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. But Longclaw…
Episode 10,sam,He's made of Valyrian steel. How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?
Episode 10,jon snow,Not enough. The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black?
Episode 10,sam,You were friends with me when I first got here. And I wasn't winning any elections back then.
Episode 10,jon snow,Here's to us then. Long may they sneer.
Episode 10,jon snow,What?
Episode 10,sam,"I wanted to ask you something. To ask something of you. Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown so I can become a Maester. That's what I'm meant to be, not this."
Episode 10,jon snow,"I need you here, Sam. If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust?"
Episode 10,sam,"Well, there's Edd."
Episode 10,sam,"I'll be more use to you as a Maester. More use to everyone now that Maester Aemon's gone. The Citadel has the worldo s greatest library. I'll learn about history, strategy, healing. And other things. Things that will help when they come."
Episode 10,sam,"If Gilly stays here then she'll die. And the baby that she named after me will die. And I'll end up dying, too, trying to protect them. Which means that the last thing that I'll see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them. I'd rather see a thousand White Walkers than see that."
Episode 10,sam,Thank you.
Episode 10,jon snow,"You know that The Citadel will make you swear off women, too."
Episode 10,sam,They'll bloody try.
Episode 10,jon snow,Sam?
Episode 10,sam,What?
Episode 10,jon snow,Sam…
Episode 10,jon snow,You've just been beaten half to death. How did you--
Episode 10,sam,Very carefully.
Episode 10,jon snow,I'm glad the end of the worldo s working out for someone.
Episode 10,sam,I'll come back.
Episode 10,jon snow,To your return.
Episode 10,sam,To my return.
Episode 10,brienne,How do you know it's Stannis?
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,Trench here. Another one 300 yards from the castle wall. Hurry them along. And send out a foraging party immediately. The siege begins at sunrise.
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,Bolton has women fighting for him.
Episode 10,brienne,I do not fight for the Boltons. I'm Brienne of Tarth. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face. You murdered him? With blood magic?
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,I did.
Episode 10,brienne,"In the name of Renly of House Baratheon, First of his Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm, I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die. Do you have any last words?"
Episode 10,stannis baratheon,"Go on, do your duty."
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,Go with her. Please.
Episode 10,sansa stark,"I know what Ramsay is. I know what he'll do to me. If I'm going to die, let it happen while there's some of me left."
Episode 10,theon greyjoy,He's coming back.
Episode 10,arya stark,"You were the first person on my list, you know. For killing Syrio Forel, remember him? Probably not. I've gotten a few of the others. The Many Faced God stole a few more for me. I'm glad he left me you. Do you know who I am?"
Episode 10,arya stark,I can't hear you.
Episode 10,arya stark,You know who I am. I'm Arya Stark.
Episode 10,arya stark,Do you know who you are?
Episode 10,arya stark,You're no one. You're nothing.
Episode 10,arya stark,"No! No! No, you don't die! Don't die!"
Episode 10,arya stark,He was my friend.
Episode 10,arya stark,But if you're… Who's this?
Episode 10,arya stark,I can't see!
Episode 10,arya stark,What's happening?! What's happening?!
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Thank you.
Episode 10,bronn,Maybe I'll come visit you sometime.
Episode 10,bronn,Don't wait too long. I've a noble woman to marry back home.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,"Whenever you're ready, My Lord."
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Try not to lose it this time.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,I know you didn't want to leave Dorne. But I'm glad you're coming home. Your mother's desperate to see you. And I'm glad Trystane's coming with us. He seems like a nice boy. You're lucky. Arranged marriages are rarely so… so well arranged.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,"If she sees you're happy, I'm sure she will."
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children?
Episode 10,jaime lannister,"I'm not so sure about that. Listen. There's something I've wanted to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. So. Now that you've seen more of the world, you've learned how complicated things can be. People can be. The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you've fallen in love with Trystane. It was an accident, really, I mean what were the chances? You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry? My point is… we don't choose whom we love. We just… It's beyond our control. I sound like an idiot."
Episode 10,jaime lannister,What I'm trying to say. What I'm trying and failing to say…
Episode 10,jaime lannister,No. I'm afraid you don't.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Myrcella?
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Myrcella?!
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Myrcella?! Myrcella?!
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"You love her, don't you? How could you not. Of course, it's hopeless for the both of you. Sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight. Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But, we always want the wrong woman."
Episode 10,jorah mormont,Torgo Nudho.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Dwarf. I believe that's the word. Apologies. My Valyrian is a bit “nostril”.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Rusty” Thank you.
Episode 10,jorah mormont,None of that matters now. The longer we sit here bantering the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"He's right. The dragon headed north. If we're going to find her, that's where we're to go."
Episode 10,jorah mormont,We? You're a Lannister. The Queen intends to remove your family from power.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,And I intend to help her do it.
Episode 10,jorah mormont,You've been here for how many days now? I've fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,You betrayed her!
Episode 10,jorah mormont,Careful now.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"And she exiled you, twice, I believe?"
Episode 10,jorah mormont,The second time thanks to you.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep."
Episode 10,jorah mormont,If I ever kill you your eyes will be wide open.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Pardon me?
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"Not precisely, but I have other skills that'd be very useful--"
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,I have fought. I don't claim to be a great warrior.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Middling.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,And drink. I've survived so far.
Episode 10,jorah mormont,He's a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language. Why would the Meereenese listen to him?
Episode 10,varys,I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,I suppose there's no point in asking how you found me.
Episode 10,varys,"The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east. If one knows how to listen. They tell me you've already found favor with the Mother of Dragons."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"Well, she didn't execute me, so that's a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her, and I'm stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade?"
Episode 10,varys,Information is the key. You need to learn your enemies' strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.
Episode 10,varys,"If only. A grand old city, choking on violence, corruption, and deceit. Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive, ungainly beast?"
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,I did miss you.
Episode 10,varys,"Oh, I know."
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,We have to go home.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,"My poor, sweet thing. Does it hurt? We have to go home. Drogon? Can you take me back to Meereen?"
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,How far did you carry me?
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,"Drogon, we need to return. My people need me."
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,"Well, there's no food. At the very least you can hunt us some supper."
Episode 10,cersei lannister,"I have sinned. I see that now. How could I have been so blind for so long. I want to be clean again. I want absolution. The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high, and with its holy light--"
Episode 10,cersei lannister,"Once I've confessed, will I be free?"
Episode 10,cersei lannister,"The Mother have mercy then. I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage, I confess."
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Lancel Lannister.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,I was lonely and afraid.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,A husband of whoring every chance he got.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,May the gods forgive me.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,No.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,I do.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,"A lie. A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon. He wants the Throne, but his brother's children stand in his way, so he claims they are not his brothers'. The filth. There is not one shred of truth to it. I deny it."
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Trial? I have confessed?
Episode 10,cersei lannister,I bow to the wisdom of your High Holiness. But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother's mercy. I haven't seen my son… I don't know how long it's been. I need to see him. Please.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Thank you. Thank you.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,"I will, I will. I swear it, day and night."
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Am I free to go?
Episode 10,cersei lannister,My atonement?
Episode 10,davos,He came to your aid. Stannis. Now he needs you!
Episode 10,jon snow,We don't have enough men to make any difference.
Episode 10,davos,The wildlings will make a difference!
Episode 10,jon snow,"The wildlings won't ever fight for Stannis, I told you before--"
Episode 10,davos,"You saved their bloody lives. If they're going to live in the Seven Kingdoms, safe behind our wall, they ought to fight for the damn place."
Episode 10,jon snow,It's not their fight!
Episode 10,jon snow,Stannis?
Episode 10,davos,Shireen? The princess?
Episode 10,jon snow,Are you sure he's talking about Benjen?
Episode 10,jon snow,He could be lying.
Episode 10,jon snow,Where is he?
Episode 10,jon snow,Olly…
Episode 1,davos,Help me get him inside
Episode 1,davos,How many of your brothers do you think you can trust?
Episode 1,davos,Does the wolf know you?
Episode 1,davos,We need all the help we can get
Episode 1,davos,"I can't speak for the flames, but he's gone"
Episode 1,davos,He'll have seen we didn't come Thorne will have made it official by now Castle Black is his
Episode 1,davos,We don't have the numbers
Episode 1,davos,"It's not enough I didn't know Lord Commander Snow for long, but I have to believe he wouldn't have wanted his friends to die for nothing"
Episode 1,davos,"We need to fight, but we don't need to die Not if we have help"
Episode 1,davos,You're not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow
Episode 1,theon greyjoy,We can't stop
Episode 1,theon greyjoy,We have to cross here
Episode 1,sansa stark,I can't
Episode 1,theon greyjoy,It's the only way to throw off the hounds
Episode 1,sansa stark,But it's too cold I can't I won't make it I'll die
Episode 1,theon greyjoy,I've seen what his hounds do to a person This way is better
Episode 1,theon greyjoy,Over here Come on
Episode 1,theon greyjoy,Sansa Sansa
Episode 1,theon greyjoy,Stay here. I'll lure them away
Episode 1,sansa stark,"No, I won't make it without you"
Episode 1,theon greyjoy,"You will Go north, only north Jon is Lord Commander at Castle Black He'll help you"
Episode 1,theon greyjoy,Dead
Episode 1,theon greyjoy,She broke her leg jumping from the ramparts I left her to die in the snow
Episode 1,brienne,"Lady Sansa, I offer my services once again I will shield your back and keep your council and give my life for yours if need be I swear it by the old gods and the new"
Episode 1,sansa stark,And I vow...that you shall always have a place by my hearth and…
Episode 1,sansa stark,Meat and mead at my table And I pledge to ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor I swear it by the old gods and the new Arise
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Myrcella…
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Do you remember the first time you saw a dead body?
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Mother
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"All I could think about when she died was what would happen to her now Every day, every night, what does Mama look like now? Has she started to bloat? Has her skin turned black? Have her lips peeled back from her teeth?"
Episode 1,cersei lannister,I think about locking Myrcella in a crypt
Episode 1,cersei lannister,I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"Shh, shh Don't think about it"
Episode 1,cersei lannister,I have to I have to It's not right she has to suffer alone
Episode 1,jaime lannister,She's not suffering She's gone No one can hurt her anymore
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"She was good From her first breath, she was so sweet I don't know where she came from She was nothing like me No meanness, no jealous, just good"
Episode 1,jaime lannister,I know
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"I thought if I could make something so good, so pure...maybe I'm not a monster"
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Listen -- listen to me She was my daughter and I failed her
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"No, I knew this would happen The witch told me years ago She promised me three children She promised me they'd die “And gold their shrouds” Everything she said came true You couldn't have stopped it It's prophecy It's fate"
Episode 1,jaime lannister,You don't believe that
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"Of course I do You told me yourself when Father died You said we had to stay together You said people would try to tear us apart, take what's ours That was a prophecy, too I didn't listen to you, and everything you said came true"
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,We're never going to fix what's wrong with this city from the top of an 800-foot pyramid
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,We'll be fine We're dressed like common merchants
Episode 1,varys,You walk like a rich person
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,You've spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk?
Episode 1,varys,You walk as though the paving stones were your personal property I used to steal from people like you when I was a boy
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,It's a good thing you're not a boy anymore...because you have no cock
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,For your baby To eat
Episode 1,varys,She thinks you want to eat her baby
Episode 1,varys,"His Valyrian is terrible He only wants to give you money, so your baby can eat"
Episode 1,varys,Mhysa means mother in Valyrian
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,I know what mhysa means
Episode 1,varys,Who wrote it?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Hard to know Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be
Episode 1,varys,The Sons of the Harpy?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Very possibly Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property, told them human beings weren't even property to begin with You can see why they're unhappy Of course, it could also be the freed men"
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them
Episode 1,varys,She did fly away on a dragon and not come back
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,It's a problem
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill Whoever you are, wherever you go, someone in this city wants to murder you We can't fight an enemy we don't know"
Episode 1,varys,"The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack in the fighting pits very carefully, which means they take orders from someone"
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,And have you started looking for that someone?
Episode 1,varys,"My little birds have already taken wing Soon they'll return, singing songs of men in gold masks"
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Well, we won't be sailing to Westeros anytime soon"
Episode 1,jorah mormont,Ram

Episode 2,cersei lannister,Get out of my way
Episode 2,cersei lannister,What are the king's orders?
Episode 2,cersei lannister,You're barring me from attending my own daughter's funeral?
Episode 2,cersei lannister,I would like to speak to my son
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Almost
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Your mother wouldn't do that
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Are you angry with her?
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Then why didn't you let her come? She has every right to be here
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"They're not putting your mother in a cell ever again Not while I'm here Why haven't you gone to see her? Everything she endured, she did it for you"

Episode 2,jaime lannister,What about my sins?
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"I broke a sacred oath and stabbed my king in the back I killed my own cousin When the gods judged my brother guilty, I helped him escape their justice What atonement do I deserve?"
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"Oh, the gods won't mind They've spilled more blood than the rest of us combined"
Episode 2,jaime lannister,They should be closer if you mean for them to save you
Episode 2,jaime lannister,I've fought against worse odds
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Did they put her in the red gown or the gold?

Episode 2,cersei lannister,It's all right
Episode 2,cersei lannister,Always
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"If I lost my cock, I'd drink all the time"
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Meaning no offense He makes dwarf jokes, I make eunuch jokes"
Episode 2,varys,I do not make dwarf jokes
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,You think them
Episode 2,varys,"So, the fleet It's been burned"
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Surely there's some good news lurking somewhere
Episode 2,varys,Astapor and Yunkai have stopped asking us for aid
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Perhaps they can tell us their secret
Episode 2,varys,"The Masters have retaken both cities Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver's Bay has returned to the slavers"
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,What about the dragons? We have two of them here beneath the pyramid

Episode 3,davos,The lady brought you back.
Episode 3,jon snow,Nothing There was nothing at all

Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Where else would I go? Every khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen
Episode 3,varys,I don't know how you stand it in all that leather
Episode 3,varys,If we could have the room
Episode 3,varys,"You look lovely today, my dear You really do How you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat"
Episode 3,varys,I am not a torturer
Episode 3,varys,Though it so often is what people deserve
Episode 3,varys,"And it does provide answers But they're usually the wrong answers My job is to find the right answers Do you know how I do that? I do it by making people happy I'd like to make you happy, Vala That's your name, isn't it, Vala?"
Episode 3,varys,"That's all right I know who you are and what you've done You've done a lot You've sacrificed your body for a cause, which is more than most people do And you've helped the Sons of the Harpy murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons"
Episode 3,varys,"I understand Well, that makes perfect sense from your perspective I have a different perspective, of course I think it's important that you try to see things from my perspective just as I will try to see them from yours Because that is the only way that I can make you and Dom happy That is how you pronounce it -- Dom? I'm afraid I don't really speak the language Such a handsome boy Those big, brown eyes Good luck keeping the ladies away"
Episode 3,varys,"Children are blameless I have never hurt them Your boy is in no immediate danger, this I swear to you But between us, dear, you did conspire to kill the queen's soldiers We both know the penalty for that crime How will poor Dom get on without his mother? And with his breathing problem"
Episode 3,varys,"Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem There is a third option, though A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos I've already booked passage for a woman and her young son I'll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again"
Episode 3,varys,Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it Far too heavy for me The boat sails at dawn You need to decide now A new life for you and Dom or…
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"What should we do while we wait? To pass the time, what should we do? What should we talk about?"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,You speak 19 languages You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"You two, you spend a great deal of time together What would you be talking about if I weren't here?"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,That's good That's very good
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,But that's a report I was thinking more of a conversation A wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Me Just now All right, no conversations Let's play a game"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"You don't play games, either one of you, ever?"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"There, that's a start"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Oh no, no, no Not that, of course not that Innocent games, fun games, drinking games"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Until you do
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Alright No drinking We can play without drinking It's a wonderful game I invented it Here's how it works I make a statement about your past If I'm wrong, I drink And if I'm right -- Maybe we can't play without drinking"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Oh, you took your time"
Episode 3,varys,Sorry I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy Some things you can't rush
Episode 3,varys,The good masters of Astapor And the wise masters of Yunkai With help from their friends in Volantis
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,You see? You don't even have to worry about the local rebellion We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Asatapor and Yunkai, who remain to defend the free people of Meereen?"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,You may be right
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Possibly
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,It's a conversation
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Tell me, can the little birds get a message to the good Masters of Astapor, the wise Masters of Yunkai, the benevolent enslavers of Volantis"
Episode 3,varys,"Of course Man can be fickle, but birds always trust"
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Varys's little birds
Episode 3,jaime lannister,What did you do to him exactly I haven't been able to get a clear answer
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"Does he understand what we're saying I mean, to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place"
Episode 3,jaime lannister,So tell him to march into the sept and crush the High Sparrow's head like a melon
Episode 3,cersei lannister,The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him Ser Gregor will can't face them all And he won't have to He'll only have to face one
Episode 3,jaime lannister,Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Not yet
Episode 3,jaime lannister,That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"Don't stop at the city I want little birds in Dorne, in Highgarden, in the North If someone is planning on making our losses their gains I want to hear it If someone is laughing at the queen who walk naked through the streets covered in shit, I want to hear I want to know who they are I want to where they are"

Episode 4,jon snow,How could we know?
Episode 4,sansa stark,I spent a lot of time thinking about what as ass I was to you I wish I could change everything
Episode 4,jon snow,We were children
Episode 4,sansa stark,"I was awful, just admit it"
Episode 4,jon snow,You were occasionally awful I'm sure I can't have been great fun Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played
Episode 4,sansa stark,Can you forgive me?
Episode 4,jon snow,There's nothing to forgive
Episode 4,sansa stark,Forgive me
Episode 4,jon snow,"All right All right, I forgive you"
Episode 4,jon snow,"You'd think after thousands of years, the Night's Watch would have learned how to make a good ale"
Episode 4,sansa stark,Where will you go?
Episode 4,jon snow,"Where will we go? If I don't watch over you, Father's ghost will come back and murder me"

Episode 4,jon snow,I'm tired of fighting
Episode 4,jon snow,It's all I've done since I left home I've killed brothers of the Night's Watch I've killed wildlings I've killed men that I admire I hanged a boy younger than Bran I fought and I lost
Episode 4,sansa stark,"If we don't take back the North, we'll never be safe I want you to help me But I'll do it myself if I have to"
Episode 4,davos,My lady
Episode 4,davos,Will you stay here at Castle Black?
Episode 4,davos,You serve Jon Snow now?
Episode 4,davos,"Forgive me, my lady, I thought that was Stannis"
Episode 4,davos,What happened down there?

Episode 4,petyr baelish,The Defender of the Vale!
Episode 4,petyr baelish,My lord Come and see
Episode 4,petyr baelish,I missed your name day Go on
Episode 4,petyr baelish,A gyrfalcon The greatest and rarest of birds
Episode 4,petyr baelish,Indeed I was
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"On our way to the Fingers, we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men Seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting"
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"Tell me, Lord Royce, how many people knew of my travel plans with Sansa Stark? I shared my intentions with you and no one else"
Episode 4,petyr baelish,Your home is the Vale The Lord of the Vale stands before us And only his judgment concerns me
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"Lord Royce has served the Vale well He;s enjoyed a distinguished military career If we could trust his absolute loyalty, he would make a capable commander in the wars to come"
Episode 4,petyr baelish,I think he deserves one more chance What do you say?
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"I bring good news My friends in the North tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell I expect she's headed to Castle Black where her brother serves as Lord Commander But she won't be safe there, not with the Boltons after her"
Episode 4,petyr baelish,That was my instinct as well
Episode 4,petyr baelish,Our lord has spoken Gather the Knights of the Vale The time has come to join the fray
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"I did As a clever man once told me, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends”"
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Yes, that's the military approach And how has that worked here in Meereen? I represent the diplomatic approach"
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,We enter these negotiations with open eyes Trust me My own recent experience with slavery has taught me the horrors of that institution
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,Long enough to know
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,And now you speak for the Good Masters of AstaporHere's to reversals of fortune
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Let's make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want"
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,Queen Daenerys won't stay in Meereen forever Her path takes her westward
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Friends, friends, friends, please"
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing That is the way of the world I'm not here to change the way of the world
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,You don't need slaves to make money There haven't been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it So here is the queen's proposal Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slaver's Bay time to adjust to the new order
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice"
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses, of course, at fair prices In exchange, you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy"
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same I do hope you accept, my friends You will not receive a better offer"
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it And as a parting gift to our honored guests…
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,Give freedom a chance See if it doesn't taste every bit as good as what came before
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,My friends! Large sorry...you wait so fat time
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,Excellent
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,I did
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,But I am not your ruler I'm not the Breaker of Chains I'm not the Unburnt And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,Because our queen chose me as her advisor Until she returns from her travels --
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,Soon You have my word
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations As commander of the Unsullied, he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace"
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,We offered terms
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,Those men respect you
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,As do I
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,I am not betraying her work I am trying to save her city
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,For a short time
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,You're right Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once War is a horror that should be ended at once I can't do both today
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,I don't trust the Masters I trust their self-interest They're trustworthy if they're convinced that working with me is in their self-interest
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast Their contempt is their weakness They'll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage
Episode 4,jorah mormont,I'm fine
Episode 4,jorah mormont,What?
Episode 4,jorah mormont,Makes me sad You'll disappoint her before long She'll move on

Episode 4,jorah mormont,"The road running through the Horse Gate, they call that the godsway"
Episode 4,jorah mormont,"Eastern Market, Western Market When Khal Drogo died, she was supposed to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen, the widows of the dead khals That's where they would have taken her, the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen"
Episode 4,jorah mormont,It's forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city
Episode 4,jorah mormont,"If they spot us and we're unarmed, we'll say we're traders heading for the Western Market But if they see weapons…"
Episode 4,jorah mormont,"There's 100,000 of them down there We can't fight our way out We wait till dark, and then we'll find her"
Episode 4,jorah mormont,Don't worry it didn't touch you
Episode 4,jorah mormont,I know what happens
Episode 4,jorah mormont,Come on
Episode 4,jorah mormont,My friends...We wandered off from the Western Market and got lost Could you show us the way back?
Episode 4,jorah mormont,"Wine Come down to my stall tomorrow, I'll give you a cask of the Arbor's finest"
Episode 4,jorah mormont,"If they find a body with a stab wound, the whole city will be looking for us"
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,That is more than most have
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,I need to make water
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,I will never run from Dothraki
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,I needed fresh air The old women stink
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,You must have been very young when your Khal died
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Too bad he didn't die sooner
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Mm-hmm
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,They do Would you like to see them one day?
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"No, don't hurt her"
Episode 4,jorah mormont,We have to go now
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive
Episode 4,jorah mormont,All we can do is try
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,No We can do more than that And you're going to help me
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"And you...Have faith in me, Khaleesi Do not betray me"
Episode 4,cersei lannister,is walking down the hall to TOMMEN's chamber. She hears MAESTER PYCELLE talking.
Episode 4,cersei lannister,enters the room
Episode 4,cersei lannister,What are you doing here?
Episode 4,cersei lannister,Leave.
Episode 4,cersei lannister,Is this a Small Council meeting?
Episode 4,cersei lannister,"Since I've missed the past several Small Coucil meetings, I wanted to speak to you about a few things."
Episode 4,cersei lannister,"As have we all, unfortunately."
Episode 4,cersei lannister,Look at me. What did they do to me? To the king's own mother?
Episode 4,cersei lannister,It's all right. It's done. It's in the past. And of course Margaery's safety is paramount.
Episode 4,cersei lannister,"Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant. Margaery is the queen. Queens must command respect. Kings even more so. Not just for their own sake, but for everyone's. The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens. No respect for anything in this world. He has no use for the things of this world. He want to knock them down and replace them with what? With fantasies. With beggars in the street. With nothing."
Episode 4,cersei lannister,You've spoken with him?
Episode 4,cersei lannister,"It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly, given his constant prattling about the truth. I am your mother. You can always trust me."
Episode 4,cersei lannister,The Small Council meeting has been postponed on the king's orders.
Episode 4,cersei lannister,You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one's rivals.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Cersei is the mother of the king. She has the king's ear and his trust. And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.
Episode 4,cersei lannister,"The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back. Here we are. Well done to us. Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty, peasant hands. In a few days, he'll have a trial for me. But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement. Yes, Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city."
Episode 4,cersei lannister,I agree.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"You've got the second largest army in Westeros. You'll bring them into the city, stop queen Margaery's humiliation before it starts, and take her back into Crown custody."
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"You'll take no action at all. When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down. Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?"
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything. When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery's back at Tommen's side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?"
Episode 4,cersei lannister,You hate these fanatics as much as we do. You hate what they've done to your son. Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good?
Episode 4,cersei lannister,Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,approaches Pyke Castle by boat.
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,I escaped.
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,I'm sorry.
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,I know. I know and I'm sorry.
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,He broke me. He broke me into a thousand pieces.
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,You don't know.
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,Where else could I go?
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,"No, no. I only heard he died after we docked."
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,I didn't know.
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,I don't want to be king.
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,I shouldo ve listened to you. You're the only one --
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,You should rule the Iron Islands. Let me help you.
Episode 4,sansa stark,"JON SNOW, BRIENNE, TORMUND, and DOLOROUS EDD are eating at a table. SANSA looks at the meat on her fork. JON SNOW, DOLOROUS EDD, and TORMUND eat vigorously. BRIENNE looks around at the men eating. TORMUND stares intently at BRIENNE. BRIENNE looks away. TORMUND smiles. DOLOROUS EDD notices their interaction."
Episode 4,sansa stark,That's all right. There are more important things.
Episode 4,jon snow,I'm not Lord Commander anymore.
Episode 4,jon snow,SNOW takes the letter. The man leaves. JON SNOW sees the seal of House Bolton. He opens the scroll and starts reading.

Episode 4,jon snow,"His direwolf's skin is on my floor. Come and see. I want my bride back. Send her to me, bastard, and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers. Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection. You will watch as I skin them living. You --"
Episode 4,sansa stark,Go on.
Episode 4,jon snow,It's just more of the same.
Episode 4,jon snow,"SNOW puts the letter away, but SANSA takes it and continues reading."
Episode 4,sansa stark,"You will watch as my soldiers take turns raping your sister. You will watch as my dogs your wild little brother. Then I will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest. Come and see. Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North."
Episode 4,jon snow,Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.
Episode 4,sansa stark,His father's dead. Ramsay killed him. And now he has Rickon.
Episode 4,jon snow,We don't know that.
Episode 4,sansa stark,"Yes, we do."
Episode 4,sansa stark,"I heard him say 5,000 once when he was talking about Stannis's attack."
Episode 4,jon snow,How many do you have?
Episode 4,sansa stark,You're the son of the last true Warden of the North. Northern families are loyal. They'll fight for you if you ask.
Episode 4,sansa stark,A monster has taken our home and our brother. We have to go back to Winterfell and save them both.
Episode 4,jon snow,SNOW nods.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"enters, ushered by the Lhazareen woman and the leader of the Dosh Khaleen. The khals bow their heads."
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Don't you want to know what I think?
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,No. I don't want either of those things.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,I know where I am. I have been here before. This is where the Dosh Khaleen pronounced my child the Stallion Who Mounts the World.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,This is where Drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends. To ride wooden horses across the Black Salt Sea as no khal has done before. He promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses. He swore to me before the Mother of Mountains.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"And here, now, what great matters do the Great Khals discuss? Which little villages you'll raid, how many girls you'll get to fuck, how many horses you'll demand in tribute. You are small men. None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki. But I am. So I will."
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,lays her hand on a fire pit.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,You're not going to serve. You're going to die.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"knocks down all the fire pits one by one. The khals cower away from the flame. The flame begins to cover the entire temple. The khals run to the door and try to escape, but the door has been barred. JORAH and DAARIO watch the temple burning from the outside. The Dothraki people gather around the burning temple. DAENERYS grabs the final fire pit and knocks it in KHAL MORO's direction. The fire engulfs the entire temple and kills all the khals. DAENERYS walks out of the fire, unharmed and naked. All the Dothraki bow to DAENERYS. JORAH and DAARIO walk up to the steps burning temple. JORAH bows to DAENERYS. DAARIO stares at her and then bows."
Episode 5,sansa stark,Yes?
Episode 5,sansa stark,How far is Mole's Town?
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"Sansa. Lady Brienne. When I heard you had escaped WInterfell, I feared the worst. You have no idea how happy I am to see you unharmed."
Episode 5,sansa stark,Unharmed? What are you doing here?
Episode 5,petyr baelish,I rode north with the Knights of the Vale to come to your aid. They're encamped at Moat Cailin as we speak.
Episode 5,sansa stark,"To come to my aid? Did you know about Ramsay? If you didn't know, you're an idiot. If you did know, you're my enemy."
Episode 5,sansa stark,"Would you like to hear about our wedding night? He never hurt my face. He needed my face, the face of Ned Stark's daughter. But the rest of me, he did what he liked with the rest of me as long as I could still give him an heir. What do you think he did?"
Episode 5,petyr baelish,I can't begin to contemplate --
Episode 5,sansa stark,What do you think he did to me?
Episode 5,brienne,Lady Sansa asked you a question.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,He beat you.
Episode 5,sansa stark,"Yes, he enjoyed that. What else do you think he did?"
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"Sansa, I --"
Episode 5,sansa stark,What else?
Episode 5,petyr baelish,Did he cut you?
Episode 5,sansa stark,Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,I didn't know.
Episode 5,sansa stark,I thought you knew everyone's secrets.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"I made a mistake, a horrible mistake. I underestimated a stranger."
Episode 5,sansa stark,"The other things he did, ladies aren't supposed to talk about those things, but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time. I can still feel it. I don't mean in my tender heart it still pains me so. I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,I'm so sorry.
Episode 5,sansa stark,You said you would protect me.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,And I will. You must believe me when I tell you that I will.
Episode 5,sansa stark,I don't believe you anymore. I don't need you anymore. You can't protect me. You won't even be able to protect yourself if I tell Brienne to cut you down. And why shouldn't I?
Episode 5,petyr baelish,"Do you want me to beg for my life? If that's what you want, I will. Whatever you ask that is in my power, I will do."
Episode 5,sansa stark,What if I want you to die here and now?
Episode 5,petyr baelish,Then I will die.
Episode 5,sansa stark,You freed me from the monsters who murdered my family and you gave me to other monsters who murdered my family. Go back to Moat Cailin. My brother and I will take back the North on our own. I never want to see you again.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,I would do anything to undo what's been done to you. I know that I can't. Will you allow me to say one more thing before I go? Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish has gathered what remains of the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun. You might consider seeking him out. The time may come when you need an army loyal to you.
Episode 5,sansa stark,I have an army.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,Your brother's army.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,Half-brother.
Episode 5,arya stark,Who was the first?
Episode 5,arya stark,Where did they go?
Episode 5,arya stark,A girl has no desires.
Episode 5,arya stark,Who?
Episode 5,arya stark,A girl will poison the rum. Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.
Episode 5,arya stark,If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall…
Episode 5,arya stark,She's a good actress.
Episode 5,arya stark,Seems like a decent woman.
Episode 5,arya stark,No. Who wants her dead?
Episode 5,arya stark,The younger actress. She's jealous because Lady Crane is better.
Episode 5,arya stark,A girl has decided.
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,I am Theon Greyjoy...last living son of Balon Greyjoy.
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,"And she is your rightful ruler. Those of you that have sailed under her, and there are many of you here, you know what she is."
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,She is a reaver!
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,She is a warrior!
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,She is ironborn!
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,We will find no better leader. This is our queen.
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,"That would have been hard to do. You weren't here. Last I heard, you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time."
Episode 5,theon greyjoy,You were gone. Yara was here. Being Ironborn. Leading Ironborn. Getting ready to bring us back to glory.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,I banished you twice. You came back twice. And you saved my life. So I can't take you back and I can't send you away.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,You must send me away.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,Is there a cure?
Episode 5,jorah mormont,I don't know.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,How long does it take?
Episode 5,jorah mormont,I don't know that either. But I've seen what happens when it goes far enough. I'll end things before that.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,"Don't be. All I've ever wanted was to serve you. Tyrion Lannister was right. I love you. I'll always love you. Goodbye, Khaleesi."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"Do not walk away from your queen, Jorah the Andal."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,You have not been dismissed. You pledged yourself to me. You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"Well, I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world. I command you to heal yourself and then return to me. When I take the Seven Kingdoms, I need you by my side."
Episode 5,varys,"In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?"
Episode 5,varys,And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men.
Episode 5,varys,So it's safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.
Episode 5,varys,For now is the best we get in our profession.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,It's not enough.
Episode 5,varys,"Considering the city was on the brink of civil war, I'd say it's a good start."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"It's not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and...all that."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced."
Episode 5,varys,Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Who said anything about “him”?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Welcome to Meereen.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,That's about the extent of my Valyrian.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Thank you for travelling all this way. I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,The truth is we need your help. We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to --
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Yes.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,She did indeed.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Ideally we'd avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,I'd settle for obeyed.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,That sounds most excellent --
Episode 5,varys,"A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses. He, too, had a glorious destiny. He attacked King's Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me. Last I had heard, he'd been defeated again, this time at Winterfell and this time for good."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,We'd be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.
Episode 5,varys,I suppose it's hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake. Isn't that the whole point of being a fanatic? You're always right. Everything is the Lordo s will.
Episode 5,varys,"And you, an honest servant of the lord, why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis?"
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen."
Episode 5,jon snow,"We can't defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men."
Episode 5,davos,"Aside from the Starks and the Boltons, the most powerful houses in the North are the Umbers, the Karstarks, and the Manderlys."
Episode 5,davos,"The Umbers and the Karstarks have already declared for the Boltons, so we're not doing so well there."
Episode 5,sansa stark,The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. They can hang. But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay without knowing they had another choice.
Episode 5,davos,"I beg your pardon, my lady, but they know that a Stark beheaded their father. I don't think we can count on them either."
Episode 5,sansa stark,"How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?"
Episode 5,davos,"Precious little, my lady."
Episode 5,sansa stark,"My father always said Northerners are different. More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders."
Episode 5,davos,"They may well be loyal, but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family? I may not know the North, but I know men. They're more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don't want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause. If Jon's going to convince them to fight alongside him, they need to believe it's a fight they can win."
Episode 5,jon snow,"There are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood. Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others. We can start small and build."
Episode 5,sansa stark,"The North remembers. They remember the Stark name. People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door."
Episode 5,davos,I don't doubt it. But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.
Episode 5,sansa stark,"No, but I do."
Episode 5,sansa stark,"Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark's son as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's. Ant there are also the Tullys. They're not Northern, but they will back us against the Boltons without question."
Episode 5,davos,I didn't know the Tullys still had an army.
Episode 5,sansa stark,My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun.
Episode 5,jon snow,How do you know that?
Episode 5,sansa stark,Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.
Episode 5,davos,"That's good. The Blackfish is a legend. His support would mean a great deal. Stark, Tully, a few more houses, almost starts to look like a winning side."
Episode 5,brienne,"I've sworn to protect you, my lady."
Episode 5,sansa stark,You heard them. We need more men and my uncle has an army.
Episode 5,brienne,We can send the Blackfish a raven.
Episode 5,sansa stark,Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it. It has to be you.
Episode 5,sansa stark,Ride for Riverrun. My uncle will talk to you and you'll know how to talk to him.
Episode 5,sansa stark,What is it?
Episode 5,brienne,I don't like leaving you here alone.
Episode 5,sansa stark,With Jon?
Episode 5,brienne,"Not him. He seems trustworthy. A bit brooding, perhaps. I suppose that's understandable, considering. The others, though. Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic. And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they? Already out looking for a leader with better prospects. And that wildling fellow with the beard --"
Episode 5,sansa stark,"Jon isn't Tormund. Jon isn't Davos, the Red Woman, or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon. He's my brother. He'll keep me safe. I trust him."
Episode 5,brienne,Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?
Episode 5,jon snow,New dress?
Episode 5,sansa stark,I made it myself. Do you like it?
Episode 5,jon snow,"Year, it's -- I like the wolf bit."
Episode 5,sansa stark,"Good, because I made this for you."
Episode 5,sansa stark,I made it like the one Father used to wear. As near as I can remember.
Episode 5,jon snow,"Thank you, Sansa."
Episode 5,sansa stark,You're welcome.
Episode 5,jon snow,Don't knock it down while I'm gone.
Episode 6,sam,"Oh, yes. Once you get south of the Riverlands, very different sorts of trees start to take over. Maple, elm, beech, poplar. The odd willow. And of course now that summer's over, you'll start seeing the autumn colors coming in. Still, you'll find more green here than anywhere else."
Episode 6,sam,"I didn't think I'd ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn't. A person just doesn't feel welcome at that point."
Episode 6,sam,And I certainly didn't expect to be introducing him to my family. So you know what to tell them.
Episode 6,sam,"Yes, now that's very important. If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he'll take you in. He'll get an education. He'll learn to read. And you can help teach him. Huh?"
Episode 6,sam,I told them I met you in the North.
Episode 6,sam,"Well, it wasn't a very large piece of parchment."
Episode 6,sam,"The thing is...my father doesn't like wildlings. He hoped I'd make a man of myself by “killing some bloody wildlings,” so it's probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible."
Episode 6,sam,"Oh, hello, Mother."
Episode 6,sam,Oh.
Episode 6,sam,"Talla? Gods, you're a woman now."
Episode 6,sam,"Oh, um, Mother, this is Gilly."
Episode 6,sam,"Oh, and this, this is our son Samwell."
Episode 6,sam,Where is Father? And Dickon?
Episode 6,sam,It's beautiful. You're beautiful.
Episode 6,sam,"This venison, it's very tasty. Is it from today's hunt?"
Episode 6,sam,"Oh, of course. Sorry. Long journey."
Episode 6,sam,"Oh, that's a fair distance."
Episode 6,sam,"Oh, yes. Yes. A good amount. North of the Wall, you don't hunt, you don't eat."
Episode 6,sam,"Rabbits. Sometimes squirrels. I say “we,” it's my friend Jon mostly. Sometimes Edd. Oh, and Gilly. She's- - she's quite a good hunter as well. Um, huntress."
Episode 6,sam,"Oh, yes. Yes, please. Thank you, Mother."
Episode 6,sam,I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander. He wants me to- -
Episode 6,sam,"Yes. And once I have my chain, I'll return to Castle Black."
Episode 6,sam,Gilly.
Episode 6,sam,I'm sorry I let him treat you that way. I was afraid he'd turn you and Little Sam away.
Episode 6,sam,First light.
Episode 6,sam,Say good-bye to him for me.
Episode 6,sam,"Good-bye, Gilly."
Episode 6,sam,We're leaving.
Episode 6,sam,Get your things.
Episode 6,sam,We belong together. All of us.
Episode 6,sam,"Oh, they'll understand."
Episode 6,sam,She won't mind. Looks better on you anyway.
Episode 6,sam,It's my family's sword.
Episode 6,sam,He can bloody well try.
Episode 6,arya stark,Nothing.
Episode 6,arya stark,Three times.
Episode 6,arya stark,No.
Episode 6,arya stark,You're very good.
Episode 6,arya stark,"So change it. It would all just be farting, belching, and slapping without you."
Episode 6,arya stark,The queen loves her son more than anything. And he was taken from her before she could say good-bye. She wouldn't just cry. She would be angry. She would want to kill the person who did this to her.
Episode 6,arya stark,Mercy.
Episode 6,arya stark,I have to go. My father's waiting for me.
Episode 6,arya stark,Careful of that one. She wants you dead.
Episode 6,jaime lannister,My lord.
Episode 6,jaime lannister,Sorry to interrupt. We're here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell. Give them to us and we'll be on our way.
Episode 6,jaime lannister,"I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon, First of His Name."
Episode 6,jaime lannister,You already insulted one great house. It won't happen twice. Every last sparrow will die before Margaery walks down that street.
Episode 6,olenna tyrell,He's beaten us. That's what's happening.
Episode 6,jaime lannister,I've been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born. You don't have to do this. You don't have to do anything.
Episode 6,jaime lannister,Not when you're sitting in that chair.
Episode 6,jaime lannister,Will I be walking naked in the streets? Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods' mercy?
Episode 6,jaime lannister,I'm being sent to deal with the Blackfish. Apparently Walder Frey can't manage it on his own because he's 400 years old. Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,BEtter you're elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons.
Episode 6,jaime lannister,I'm not going to the Riverlands.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,"What, then?"
Episode 6,jaime lannister,I'm going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyone's ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows. I'll take them to the sept and I'll remove the High Sparrow's head and every other sparrow head I can find.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,You can't.
Episode 6,jaime lannister,He has our son! He stole our son! He's torn our family apart. How should we treat people who tear us apart?
Episode 6,cersei lannister,"We should treat them without mercy and we will. But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won't leave the sept alive. And without you, this is all for nothing. Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you. Show our men where their loyalties belong. Show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies. And take that stupid little castle back because it's ours and because you can."
Episode 6,jaime lannister,You'll stand trial soon. I need to he here for you.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,"It will be a trial by combat. I have the Mountain. They've made us both stronger, all of them."
Episode 6,cersei lannister,They have no idea how strong we are. No idea what we're going to do to them.
Episode 6,cersei lannister,We've always been together. We'll always be together. We're the only two people in the world.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,How many days' ride to Meereen?
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,And who has that many?
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,Nobody yet.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,I take what is mine.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,What was I made for?
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,Wait here.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,Every khal who ever lived chose three blood riders to fight beside him and guard his way. But I am not a khal. I will not choose three blood riders. I choose you all.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,I will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar! Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea?
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses?
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,"Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms, the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains?"
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,Are you with me?
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,Now and always?
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,Does it move or talk? I want to speak with you alone.
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,"Oh, this is madness!"
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,"You're not in your sanctuary now, my dear. All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about..."
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,until I tell them to stop. If I tell them to stop. You could use a good bashing.
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,What have they done to you?
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,We marched for you.
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,And what about your brother? What mercy did they show him?
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,Have you lost your mind?
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,"He is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell."
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,As a mindless fanatic.
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,You will leave for Highgarden today. There is no law that says you must stay here.
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,I will never leave you. Never.
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,"I'll see you soon, my dear."
Episode 7,jon snow,"That's what'll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you're here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they'll come for you. You're right. This isn't your fight. You shouldn't have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn't be asking you. It's not the deal we made. I need you with me if we're gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you're going to survive."
Episode 7,jon snow,Are you sure they'll come?
Episode 7,cersei lannister,I heard you were leaving King's Landing.
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,That is hardly your concern.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Your grandson is still a prisoner. You'll leave him rotting in a cell?
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,Loras rots in a cell because of you. THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you. Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,You're right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day.
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,Good.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. And now we must fight them together. We need each other.
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,"I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met. At a certain age, it's hard to recall. But the truly vile do stand out through the years. Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells? I do. I'll never forget it."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,You love your granddaughter. I love my son. It's the only truth I know. We must defend them.
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,"I'm leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells. If you're half as bright as you think you are, you'll find your way out of here, too."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Never. I'll never leave my son.
Episode 7,olenna tyrell,"What'll you do, then? You have no support. Not anymore. Your brother's gone. The High Sparrow saw to that. The rest of your family have abandoned you. The people despise you. You're surrounded by enemies, thousands of them. You're going to kill them all by yourself? You've lost, Cersei. It's the only joy I can find in all this misery."
Episode 7,bronn,"Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege. Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Someone certainly does.
Episode 7,bronn,"Oh, no. Not me. I'm just an upjumped sellsword."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,You're an anointed knight. There's quite a difference.
Episode 7,bronn,"Aye, knights don't get paid."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.
Episode 7,bronn,That's like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long. You can be the right hand I lost.
Episode 7,bronn,You promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,And you'll get all three. A Lannister always- -
Episode 7,bronn,Don't say it. Don't fucking say it.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"Lothar, is it?"
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"Cause you didn't set up a proper perimeter. You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged."
Episode 7,bronn,Good thing we're friends or we'd be fucking you in the ass right now.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"Only a fool makes threats he's not prepared to carry out. Now let's say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking. What do you think I'd do?"
Episode 7,jaime lannister,I'm here by the king's command to take back this castle. Have him bathed and fed. Unless you'd like to take his place.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"The siege is now under my command. The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts, he'll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is."
Episode 7,bronn,Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches. Set pickets every hundred yards. And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"As I said, the siege is under my command. If that's not to your liking, go home."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Get word to the Blackfish. I want a parley.
Episode 7,bronn,A parley or a fight?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,He's an old man.
Episode 7,bronn,You've got one hand. My money's on the old boy.
Episode 7,jon snow,Lady Mormont.
Episode 7,sansa stark,"I remember when you were born, my lady. You were named for my Aunt Lyanna. It was said she was a great beauty. I'm sure you will be, too."
Episode 7,jon snow,"I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact- -"
Episode 7,jon snow,Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- -
Episode 7,jon snow,"Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont's allegiance."
Episode 7,sansa stark,"I did what I had to do to survive, my lady. But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark."
Episode 7,jon snow,"Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him. Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that- -"
Episode 7,davos,"If it please, my lady, I understand how you feel."
Episode 7,davos,"Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth."
Episode 7,davos,You needn't ask your maester about my house. It's rather new.
Episode 7,davos,"You never thought you'd find yourself in your position. Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age. I never thought I'd be in my position. I was a crabber's son, then I was a smuggler. And now I found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war. But I'm here because this isn't someone else's war. It's our war."
Episode 7,davos,"Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward. He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life. Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn't between a few squabbling houses. It's between the living and the dead. And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming."
Episode 7,jon snow,Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.
Episode 7,davos,"As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided. And a divided North won't stand a chance against the Night King. You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand. But there's no hiding from this. We have to fight and we need to do it together."
Episode 7,jon snow,"Thank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect?"
Episode 7,jon snow,62?
Episode 7,davos,"If they're half as ferocious as their lady, the Boltons are doomed."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Blackfish.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,I don't have them.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"You know why I'm here. This castle belongs to House Frey. You're trespassing. In the name of King Tommen, I order you to surrender or- -"
Episode 7,jaime lannister,It won't stop with Edmure. You'll force me to storm the castle. Hundreds will die.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"We'll breach them and kill every last one of you. But if you surrender, I'll spare the lives of your men. On my honor."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"The war is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?"
Episode 7,jaime lannister,You clearly have no intention of saving your men's lives. Why did you come to treat with me?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"Well, now you have."
Episode 7,jon snow,"Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out."
Episode 7,jon snow,The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton- -
Episode 7,jon snow,House Mormont.
Episode 7,jon snow,We sent raven to Houses Manderly- -
Episode 7,jon snow,The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.
Episode 7,jon snow,Lord Glover.
Episode 7,sansa stark,I would remind you that House Glover is pledged to House Stark. Sworn to answer when called upon.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,Why did we have to come here?
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,I don't want one.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,You think Uncle Euron's hunting for us?
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,He'll find us.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,I don't want any.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,Some bad years?
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,"If I got justice, my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell."
Episode 7,davos,Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.
Episode 7,sansa stark,And that's a good thing?
Episode 7,davos,He was the most experienced commander in Westeros. He chose this place for a reason. Those mountains are a natural fortification. There's a stream down there for the horses.
Episode 7,jon snow,We're not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day..
Episode 7,davos,"Aye, the snows defeated Stannis as much as the Boltons did."
Episode 7,jon snow,We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.
Episode 7,davos,"2,000 Wildlings. 200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins- -"
Episode 7,sansa stark,62 Mormonts.
Episode 7,davos,It's not what we'd hoped for. But we still have a chance if we're careful and smart.
Episode 7,davos,For fuck's sake.
Episode 7,sansa stark,So he's your most trusted advisor now? Because he secured 62 men from a ten year old?
Episode 7,jon snow,Ser Davos is the reason I'm standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.
Episode 7,sansa stark,"Stannis who lost the Blackwater, who murdered his own brother, who doesn't have a head?"
Episode 7,sansa stark,It's not enough. We need more men.
Episode 7,jon snow,There's no time.
Episode 7,sansa stark,"If we went down to Castle Cerwyn, I know that Lord- -"
Episode 7,jon snow,We fight with the army we have.
Episode 7,davos,"Friends, this is not worth fighting over!"
Episode 7,davos,"This'll be it, now. Right now, we don't need to be fighting."
Episode 7,davos,Hold on.
Episode 7,arya stark,You're Westerosi.
Episode 7,arya stark,I want to book passage home.
Episode 7,arya stark,Why do you care?
Episode 7,arya stark,I want a cabin. And we'll leave at dawn.
Episode 7,arya stark,See you at sunrise.
Episode 8,arya stark,You're good at that. Where did you learn?
Episode 8,arya stark,And good at putting holes in them.
Episode 8,arya stark,What happened to the actress? The one who wanted you dead.
Episode 8,arya stark,Mmm.
Episode 8,arya stark,I can't.
Episode 8,arya stark,I don't think I could remember all of the lines.
Episode 8,arya stark,You wouldn't be safe. Not while she's looking for me.
Episode 8,arya stark,She doesn't have a name.
Episode 8,arya stark,Essos is east and Westeros is west. But what's west of Westeros?
Episode 8,arya stark,Nobody does. That's where all the maps stop.
Episode 8,arya stark,I'd like to see that.
Episode 8,arya stark,What's that?
Episode 8,arya stark,I don't want any.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,I'd call that a successful gambit.
Episode 8,varys,Would you?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Look around. The city has come back to life.
Episode 8,varys,You made a pact with fanatics.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,I did and it worked.
Episode 8,varys,"If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you'd say the razor worked. That doesn't mean it won't cut your throat."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Spoken like a man who has never had to shave.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,I'm going to miss you.
Episode 8,varys,I know.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,I hope you're right about this expedition of yours.
Episode 8,varys,"If I don't return, you'll know I was wrong."
Episode 8,varys,We need friends in Westeros. And we need ships.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Most of all, we need our queen."
Episode 8,varys,She'll come back. She has to. My heart's been broken too many times already.
Episode 8,varys,I'll walk the rest of the way myself. I can't go off on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Varys.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,The most famous dwarf in the world.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,Have been permitted? That's rather a tortured way of putting it.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,Who permitted them inside the Red Keep?
Episode 8,cersei lannister,The king is aware of their presence?
Episode 8,cersei lannister,His Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,"It is a request, Cousin Lancel. You are asking me for something, I'm refusing."
Episode 8,cersei lannister,He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,Get out.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,I choose violence.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,Please tell His High Holiness he's always welcome to visit.
Episode 8,brienne,"You have a keen military mind, Pod."
Episode 8,brienne,My name is Brienne of Tarth. Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister I've come to speak with him. Tell him I have his sword.
Episode 8,bronn,"Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren't we?"
Episode 8,bronn,Podrick fucking Payne. I thought you'd be dead by now.
Episode 8,bronn,Are they in there?
Episode 8,bronn,You think they're fucking?
Episode 8,bronn,"Why not? I'd fuck her. You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?"
Episode 8,bronn,"Oh. Well, he'd fuck her, that's for sure. And she's fuck him, don't you think? The way she looks at him. The way all women look at him is frankly irritating. I preferred working with the little brother on that account. Come on, you're the one with the magic cock."
Episode 8,bronn,You must have shown it to her by now.
Episode 8,bronn,Is she? Oh.
Episode 8,bronn,Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?
Episode 8,bronn,"Now, that's the truth, isn't it? You want to learn that sort of fighting?"
Episode 8,bronn,"All right, let's start with your footwork."
Episode 8,bronn,Show me your stance.
Episode 8,bronn,"Now, listen to me, Pod. See how your feet are about a yard apart?"
Episode 8,bronn,"Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you. ‘Cause they do, Pod. Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire. Do it again. Come on, don't sulk."
Episode 8,jaime lannister,I never thought you'd find her. I just assumed Sansa was dead.
Episode 8,brienne,Why would you assume that?
Episode 8,jaime lannister,"In my experience, girls like her don't live very long."
Episode 8,brienne,I don't think you know many girls like her.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,"Well, I'm proud of you. I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds."
Episode 8,jaime lannister,"Of course my sister wants Sansa dead. The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey's murder, so there is that complication. What the hell are you doing here?"
Episode 8,brienne,I've come for the Blackfish.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,You're welcome to have him.
Episode 8,brienne,Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?
Episode 8,brienne,The Tully army.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,"They're a bit occupied at the moment. I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels, so you can see the conundrum."
Episode 8,brienne,The Tullys are rebels because they're fighting for their home?
Episode 8,jaime lannister,Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.
Episode 8,brienne,As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,Exactly.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,We shouldn't argue about politics.
Episode 8,brienne,"You're a knight, Ser Jaime. I know there is honor in you. I've seen it myself."
Episode 8,jaime lannister,I'm a Lannister. Don't ask me to betray my own house.
Episode 8,brienne,I do no such thing. Take Riverrun without bloodshed. Ride south with your mission complete and your army intact.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,What do you propose?
Episode 8,brienne,Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce. Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,Why would he abandon his ancestral home?
Episode 8,brienne,Because you'll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,Have you ever met the Blackfish?
Episode 8,brienne,No.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,He's even more stubborn than you are.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,"All right. Try to talk some sense into the old goat. He won't listen, but his men might. Not everybody wants to die for someone else's home."
Episode 8,brienne,"I need your word. If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you'll grant us safe passage north."
Episode 8,jaime lannister,You have my word. You have until nightfall.
Episode 8,brienne,You gave it to me for a purpose. I've achieved that purpose.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,It's yours. It will always be yours.
Episode 8,brienne,"one last thing, Ser Jaime."
Episode 8,jaime lannister,"Yes, Lady Brienne?"
Episode 8,brienne,"Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender, and if you attack the castle, honor compels me to fight for Sansa's kin."
Episode 8,jaime lannister,Of course it does.
Episode 8,brienne,To fight you.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
Episode 8,brienne,I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.
Episode 8,brienne,"As I have said, my name is- -"
Episode 8,brienne,He always spoke highly of you.
Episode 8,brienne,Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.
Episode 8,brienne,He's not my friend.
Episode 8,brienne,"Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark. He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted. He gave me this sword to protect her. That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die."
Episode 8,brienne,You have more than she does.
Episode 8,brienne,Find the maester. We need to get a raven north to Sansa.
Episode 8,brienne,Tell her I failed.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,There's to be a royal announcement?
Episode 8,cersei lannister,Why wasn't I informed?
Episode 8,cersei lannister,To stand by my son.
Episode 8,cersei lannister,And? Was it just a rumor or something more?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"I am happy. You should both be as well. Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Now it's like a man reborn.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Why don't you drink? Why don't either of you ever drink?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Why not?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,And who made these rules? Your former masters?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Those miserable old shits didn't want you to be human. Have a drink with me.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,And you? What's your excuse?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,That's how you know it's working.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Here's to our queen. Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, long may she reign."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Do you like it?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Yes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...I'd like to have my own vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp's Delight. Only my close friends could drink it."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Grey worm?
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Right. Three lords walk into a tavern- - a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister. They order ale..."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, “Spit it out, you see shit. Spit it out.”"
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,It's funnier in Westeros.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Yes.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"A story that's supposed to make you laugh, ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps."
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"Missandei, do you like the wine?"
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Tell a joke.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,Ah!
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,You lied to us.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass. The madam says- -
Episode 8,jaime lannister,Lord Edmure.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,I apologize for the way the Freys treated you. A man of your birth deserved better. You have my word you'll be properly fed and clothes from now on.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,"The Blackfish is an old man. A good death is all he can hope for. But you, you have a child now, I've heard. A son you sired on your wedding night. You're a potent man."
Episode 8,jaime lannister,"You should be with them both. I can arrange that, you realize? Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock. A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride. And when he comes of age, he'll have a keep of his own."
Episode 8,jaime lannister,"I'll remind you that our houses are at war. I'm sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you, but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences."
Episode 8,jaime lannister,Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation? It's not.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,I'll leave the judgments to the gods.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,I was your sister's prisoner once. She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,"Perhaps, but she didn't. Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me. But I didn't hate her. I admired her. Far more than her husband or her son."
Episode 8,jaime lannister,"No, I don't, but I'm telling you anyway because you're my prisoner. You don't have a choice. The love she had for her children, I was a little awed by it. Reminded me of my sister."
Episode 8,jaime lannister,I'm not here to trade insults. Your sister was a strong- -
Episode 8,jaime lannister,I'll talk about whomever I want.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,"She loved her children. I suppose all mothers do, but Catelyn and Cersei, there's a fierceness you don't often see."
Episode 8,jaime lannister,They'd do anything to protect their babies.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,Start a war. Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies. The things we do for love.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,"That's exactly why I came here. I love Cersei. You can laugh at that if you want. You can sneer. It doesn't matter. She needs me. And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun. I'll send for your baby boy."
Episode 8,jaime lannister,"And I'll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult. Because you don't matter to me, Lord Edmure. Your son doesn't matter to me. The people in the castle don't matter to me. Only Cersei. And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her, that's what I'll do."
Episode 8,brienne,Come with us.
Episode 8,brienne,Your family is in the North. Come with us. Don't die for pride when you can fight for your blood.
Episode 8,jaime lannister,Good. Bring him to me.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,I was wrong. I admit it.
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead. If the slavers' forces- -
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,And I have acknowledged that. I'm trying- -
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,"All right, what should the army do?"
Episode 8,tyrion lannister,And then?
Episode 8,arya stark,Lady Crane?
Episode 8,arya stark,You told her to kill me.
Episode 8,arya stark,A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell and I'm going home.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Despite appearances, I think you'll find the city's on the rise."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Perhaps we should take shelter.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,The city is on the rise?
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Well, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people. But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence. The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters…"
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,it proves that no one needs a Master.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,Good. Shall we begin?
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,Do we have a plan?
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,"I will crucify the Masters. I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan."
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,You don't approve?
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King's Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Probably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. That's why Jaime killed him."
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,This is entirely different.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,You're talking about destroying cities. It's not entirely different. I'd like to suggest an alternate approach.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults."
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,"We obviously didn't communicate clearly. We're here to discuss your surrender, not mine."
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,My reign has just begun.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,Dracarys.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Thank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven."
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"It always seems a bit abstract, doesn't it, other people dying?"
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen."
Episode 9,jon snow,You don't have to be here.
Episode 9,sansa stark,"Yes, I do."
Episode 9,jon snow,You're right. There's no need for a battle. Thousands of men don't need to die. Only one of us. Let's end this the old way. You against me.
Episode 9,jon snow,"Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?"
Episode 9,sansa stark,How do we know you have him?
Episode 9,sansa stark,"You're going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton. Sleep well."
Episode 9,jon snow,"If he was smart, he'd stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out."
Episode 9,davos,"That's not his way. He knows the North is watching. If the other houses sense weakness on his part, they'll stop fearing him. He can't have that. Fear is his power."
Episode 9,jon snow,"It's his weakness, too. His mean don't want to fight for him. They're forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning..."
Episode 9,jon snow,"We're digging trenches all along our flanks. They won't be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment."
Episode 9,jon snow,A pincer move.
Episode 9,jon snow,They won't be able to hit us from the sides.
Episode 9,davos,"It's crucial that we let them charge at us. They've got the numbers, we need the patience. If we let him buckle our center, he'll pursue. Then we'll have him surrounded on three sides."
Episode 9,jon snow,No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.
Episode 9,davos,We should all get some sleep.
Episode 9,sansa stark,"So you've met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans."
Episode 9,jon snow,"Aye, for what they're worth."
Episode 9,sansa stark,"You've known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don't know. I lived with him. I know the way his mind works. I know how he likes to hurt people. Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?"
Episode 9,jon snow,You're right.
Episode 9,sansa stark,You think he's going to fall into your trap. He won't He's the one who lays traps.
Episode 9,jon snow,He's overconfident.
Episode 9,sansa stark,He plays with people. He's far better at it than you. He's been doing it all his life.
Episode 9,jon snow,"Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I've defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton."
Episode 9,sansa stark,You don't know him.
Episode 9,jon snow,"All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?"
Episode 9,sansa stark,"We'll never get him back. Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl. As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won't live long."
Episode 9,jon snow,We can't give up on our brother.
Episode 9,sansa stark,"Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake."
Episode 9,jon snow,Of course he does. What should I do differently?
Episode 9,sansa stark,I don't know! I don't know anything about battles! Just don't do what he wants you to do.
Episode 9,jon snow,"Aye, that's good advice."
Episode 9,sansa stark,You think that's obvious?
Episode 9,jon snow,"Well, it is a bit obvious."
Episode 9,sansa stark,"If you had asked for my advice earlier, I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force, or is that obvious, too?"
Episode 9,jon snow,When will we have a larger force?! We've pleaded with every house that'll have us! The Blackfish can't help us! We're lucky to have this many men!
Episode 9,sansa stark,It's not enough!
Episode 9,jon snow,"Now, it's not enough! It's what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds."
Episode 9,sansa stark,"If Ramsay wins, I'm not going back there alive. Do you understand me?"
Episode 9,jon snow,"SNOW I won't ever let him touch you again. I'll protect you, I promise."
Episode 9,sansa stark,No one can protect me. No one can protect anyone.
Episode 9,davos,You think there's hope?
Episode 9,davos,It wasn't the Boltons defeated Stannis. It was Stannis himself. I loved the man. He lifted me up and made me something. But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.
Episode 9,davos,What?
Episode 9,davos,"No, it's a manner of speaking. Not actual demons."
Episode 9,davos,"Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings."
Episode 9,davos,"No, he's not."
Episode 9,davos,"No, thanks. It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head. I can never sleep the night before a battle."
Episode 9,davos,I walk. Think and walk. Think and walk until I'm far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.
Episode 9,jon snow,My lady. You weren't at the war council.
Episode 9,jon snow,Any advice?
Episode 9,jon snow,"If I do, if I fall, don't bring me back."
Episode 9,jon snow,I'm ordering you not to bring me back.
Episode 9,jon snow,You're in my camp. I'm the commander.
Episode 9,jon snow,How do you know what he commands?
Episode 9,jon snow,Why?
Episode 9,jon snow,What kind of god would do something like that?
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf's height thinks he's the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf's height. “The height of nobility,” “a man of your stature,” “someone to look up to.” You're all making the same five or six jokes."
Episode 9,theon greyjoy,It was a long time ago.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can't imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well."
Episode 9,theon greyjoy,I didn't murder the Stark boys. But I did things that were just as bad or worse.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"Doesn't seem like it. He's still alive. It was complicated for you, I'm sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don't we?"
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,"You've brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?"
Episode 9,theon greyjoy,Not my claim. Hers.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,And what's wrong with you?
Episode 9,theon greyjoy,I'm not fit to rule.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,We can agree upon that at least.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?
Episode 9,theon greyjoy,Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence. He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from yara. He would have murdered us if we had stayed.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,We do. And both murdered by a usurper as well.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,Will their ships be enough?
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,"With the former Masters' fleet, possibly. Barely. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet."
Episode 9,theon greyjoy,There are and Euron is building more. He's going to offer them to you.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,So why shouldn't I wait for him?
Episode 9,theon greyjoy,The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing. He also wants to give you --
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?
Episode 9,theon greyjoy,He murdered our father and would have murdered us. He'll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,The Seven Kingdoms.
Episode 9,theon greyjoy,All of them.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms?
Episode 9,theon greyjoy,Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands. We ask you to give them back.
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,And that's all?
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,Reasonable.
Episode 9,tyrion lannister,What if everyone starts demanding their independence?
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,"She's not demanding, she's asking. The others are free to ask as well. Our father were evil men, all of us here. They left the world worse than they found it. We're not going to do that. We're going to leave the world better than we found it."
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,"You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms. No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping."
Episode 9,daenerys targaryen,No more.
Episode 9,davos,Prepare to charge! Prepare to charge!
Episode 9,davos,Go! Go! Follow your commander!
Episode 9,davos,We'll just kill our own men. Stand down.
Episode 9,jon snow,Get word --
Episode 9,davos,We may as well be taking shits back here.
Episode 9,davos,Follow!
Episode 9,davos,"With me, lads! Break their line!"
Episode 9,jon snow,We're going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father.
Episode 9,sansa stark,Jon.
Episode 9,sansa stark,Where is he?
Episode 9,sansa stark,Your words will disappear. Your house will disappear. Your name will disappear. All memory of you will disappear.
Episode 9,sansa stark,You haven't fed them in seven days. You said it yourself.
Episode 9,sansa stark,They were. Now they're starving.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Confess. Confess.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Confess.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,"Confess. It felt good. Beating me, starving me, frightening me, humiliating me. You didn't do it because you cared about my atonement. You did it because it felt good. I understand. I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me. I lie about fucking my brother… because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites. I killed your High Sparrow… and all his little sparrows… all his septons, all his septas, all his filthy soldiers, because it felt good to watch them burn. It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain. No thought has ever given me greater joy. Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances."
Episode 10,cersei lannister,You've always been quiet.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died. Do you remember?
Episode 10,cersei lannister,What? Now? Today? You're not going to die today. You're not going to die for quite a while. Ser Gregor.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,"This is Ser Gregor Clegane. He's quiet, too."
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Your gods have forsaken you. This is your god now.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Shame.
Episode 10,bronn,"You don't even have to do anything, do you?"
Episode 10,bronn,"You just sit there, a rich slab of beef, and all the birds come pecking."
Episode 10,jaime lannister,You're welcome to her.
Episode 10,bronn,She doesn't want me. She wants your golden fingers up her twat.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Those two have their eyes on you.
Episode 10,bronn,"They have their eyes on you, cunt."
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Not my type.
Episode 10,bronn,Not blonde enough?
Episode 10,jaime lannister,"Ladies, have you met Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay."
Episode 10,jaime lannister,There you go.
Episode 10,bronn,Maybe I'm not in the mood.
Episode 10,bronn,Fuck it.
Episode 10,bronn,No need to call me ser just because I'm an anointed knight.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,I'm sure he would be.
Episode 10,jaime lannister,"Have you done much fighting yourself, Lord Frey?"
Episode 10,jaime lannister,"No, but back in your day."
Episode 10,jaime lannister,"Yes, you're a great conqueror."
Episode 10,jaime lannister,"They don't fear the Freys, though. They fear the Lannisters. We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands. If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them, why do we need you?"
Episode 10,cersei lannister,Show me.
Episode 10,cersei lannister,"He should be with his grandfather, his brother, his sister. Burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood."
Episode 10,sam,Hello.
Episode 10,sam,From Lord Commander Snow at Castle Black.
Episode 10,sam,I'm-- I'm to be the new maester.
Episode 10,sam,He died.
Episode 10,sam,Maester Aemon became quite ill shortly after the election. He's since passed away. Which is why I'm here.
Episode 10,sam,"Yes, well, I suppose that life is irregular."
Episode 10,jon snow,"When we had feasts, our family would sit up here… and I'd sit down there."
Episode 10,jon snow,"Aye, you're right. I was luckier than most."
Episode 10,jon snow,What is that?
Episode 10,davos,Tell him. Tell him who it belonged to.
Episode 10,davos,Tell him what you did to her. Tell him!
Episode 10,davos,Why?
Episode 10,davos,You burned a little girl alive!
Episode 10,davos,"If he commands you to burn children, your Lord is evil!"
Episode 10,davos,I loved that girl like she was my own. She was good. She was kind. And you killed her!
Episode 10,davos,"The only way for what? They all died anyway! You told everyone Stannis was the one. You had him believing it, all of them fooled. And you lied."
Episode 10,davos,"Aye, you were wrong. How many died because you were wrong?"
Episode 10,davos,I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder. She admits to the crime.
Episode 10,jon snow,Do you have anything to say for yourself?
Episode 10,jon snow,"Ride south today. If you return to the North, I'll have you hanged as a murderer."
Episode 10,davos,"If you ever come back this way, I will execute you myself."
Episode 10,jon snow,I'm having the lordo s chamber prepared for you.
Episode 10,sansa stark,Mother and Father's room? You should take it.
Episode 10,jon snow,I'm not a Stark.
Episode 10,sansa stark,You are to me.
Episode 10,jon snow,You're the Lady of Winterfell. You deserve it. We're standing here because of you. The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in. They came because of you. You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.
Episode 10,sansa stark,He did.
Episode 10,jon snow,And you trust him?
Episode 10,sansa stark,"Only a fool would trust Littlefinger. I should have told you about him, about the Knights of the Vale. I'm sorry."
Episode 10,jon snow,We need to trust each other. We can't fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now.
Episode 10,sansa stark,Jon.
Episode 10,sansa stark,A raven came from the Citadel. A white raven. Winter is here.
Episode 10,jon snow,"Well, Father always promised, didn't he?"
Episode 10,olenna tyrell,"The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne, he was assassinated. 100 red scorpions, was it?"
Episode 10,olenna tyrell,"You murder your own prince, but you expect me to trust you?"
Episode 10,olenna tyrell,What is your name again? Barbaro?
Episode 10,olenna tyrell,Obara. You look like an angry little boy. Don't presume to tell me what I need.
Episode 10,olenna tyrell,"Do shut up, dear."
Episode 10,olenna tyrell,Anything from you?
Episode 10,olenna tyrell,No? Good. Let the grown women speak.
Episode 10,olenna tyrell,Cersei stole the future from me. She killed my son. She killed my grandson. She killed my granddaughter. Survival is not what I'm after now.
Episode 10,olenna tyrell,And what is my heart's desire?
Episode 10,varys,Fire and blood.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,You're not coming with us.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,You're not going to Westeros. You're staying here with the Second Sons. There's finally peace in Meereen. You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,"You promised me. “My sword is yours. My life is yours.” This is what I command. If I'm going to rule in Westeros, I'll need to make alliances. The best way to make alliances is with marriage."
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,I don't know. Maybe no one.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,I can't bring a lover to Westeros.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,So that's what you want? To be my mistress?
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,I can't.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,No one tells me to do anything.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,Don't get angry.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,"A great number of women, I imagine. Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons."
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,"We can't call it Slaver's Bay anymore, can we?"
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,"Farewell, Daario Naharis."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,How did he take it?
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,No tears.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"I know it was hard for you. You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms. That's the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler, if it's any consolation."
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,It's not.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"No, I suppose not. I'm terrible at consoling."
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, you really are."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons. Everything you've ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything. It's all yours for the taking. Are you afraid?"
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,Good. You're in the great game now. And the great game's terrifying. The only people who aren't afraid of failure are madmen like your father.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,Do you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me. A man I thought I cared for. And I felt nothing. Just impatient to get on with it.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,He wasn't the first to love you and he won't be the last.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,"Well, you have completely failed to console me."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"For what it's worth, I've been a cynic for as long as I can remember. Everyone's always asking me to believe in things-- family, gods, kings, myself. It was often tempting until I saw where belief got people. So I said no, thank you to belief. And yet here I am."
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,"I believe in you. It's embarrassing, really. I'd swear you my sword, but I don't actually own a sword."
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,It's your counsel I need.
Episode 10,tyrion lannister,It's yours. Now and always.
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,"Good. I, um… I had something made for you. I'm not sure if it's right."
Episode 10,daenerys targaryen,"Tyrion Lannister, I name you Hand of the Queen."
Episode 10,arya stark,My name is Arya Stark. I want you to know that. The last thing you're ever going to see is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.
Episode 10,sansa stark,"I'm done with all that. I came here every day when I was a girl. I prayed to be somewhere else. Back then I only ever thought about what I wanted, never about what I had."
Episode 10,sansa stark,I was a stupid girl.
Episode 10,sansa stark,What do you want?
Episode 10,sansa stark,I was wrong.
Episode 10,sansa stark,It's a pretty picture.
Episode 10,sansa stark,"You've declared for other houses before, Lord Baelish. It's never stopped you from serving yourself."
Episode 10,jon snow,"The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won. My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield."
Episode 10,jon snow,"The war is not over. And I promise you, friend, the true enemy won't wait out the storm. He brings the storm."
Episode 10,jon snow,"There's nothing to forgive, my lord."
Episode 10,jaime lannister,Come on.
Episode 1,arya stark,"When people ask you what happened here, tell them the North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey."
Episode 1,jon snow,"I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass. Dragonglass kills white walkers. It's more valuable to us now than gold. We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it. Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow."
Episode 1,jon snow,Not just the boys.
Episode 1,jon snow,We can't defend the North if only half the population is fighting.
Episode 1,jon snow,"While we're preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses. The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries. I'm not the king of the Free Folk."
Episode 1,jon snow,But if we're going to survive this winter together...
Episode 1,jon snow,Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome. The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
Episode 1,jon snow,"If they breach the wall, the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold."
Episode 1,sansa stark,"The castles committed no crimes. And we need every fortress we have for the war to come. We should give the Last Hearth and Karhold to new families, loyal families who supported us against Ramsay."
Episode 1,jon snow,The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries. They've kept faith for generation after generation.
Episode 1,sansa stark,And then they broke faith.
Episode 1,jon snow,I'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons.
Episode 1,sansa stark,So there's no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty?
Episode 1,jon snow,The punishment for treason is death. Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle. Harald Karstark died on the field of battle.
Episode 1,sansa stark,They died fighting for Ramsay. Give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you.
Episode 1,jon snow,"When I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch I executed men who betrayed me. I executed men who refused to follow orders. My father always said, ""The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword,"" and I have tried to live by those words. But I will not punish a son for his father's sins, and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is my decision, and my decision is final."
Episode 1,jon snow,Ned Umber.
Episode 1,jon snow,Alys Karstark.
Episode 1,jon snow,"For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield. I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon."
Episode 1,jon snow,Stand.
Episode 1,jon snow,"Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore. The North needs to band together, all the living north. Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always?"
Episode 1,jon snow,"You are my sister, but I am king now."
Episode 1,sansa stark,Will you start wearing a crown?
Episode 1,jon snow,"When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me."
Episode 1,sansa stark,So I can't question your decisions anymore?
Episode 1,jon snow,"Of course you can, but--"
Episode 1,sansa stark,Joffrey never let anyone question his authority. You think he was a good king?
Episode 1,jon snow,Do you think I'm Joffrey?
Episode 1,sansa stark,You're as far from Joffrey as anyone I've ever met.
Episode 1,jon snow,Thank you.
Episode 1,sansa stark,"You're good at this, you know."
Episode 1,jon snow,At what?
Episode 1,sansa stark,At ruling.
Episode 1,jon snow,No.
Episode 1,sansa stark,"You are. You are. They respect you, they really do, but you have to--"
Episode 1,sansa stark,Why are you laughing?
Episode 1,jon snow,"What did father used to say? Everything before the word ""but"" is horse shit."
Episode 1,sansa stark,He never said that to me.
Episode 1,jon snow,"No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls."
Episode 1,sansa stark,"Because he was trying to protect us. He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you. Stop trying."
Episode 1,jon snow,"All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me."
Episode 1,sansa stark,I'm not trying to undermine you.
Episode 1,sansa stark,"You have to be smarter than Father. You need to be smarter than Robb. I loved them, I miss them, but they made stupid mistakes, and they both lost their heads for it."
Episode 1,jon snow,And how should I be smarter? By listening to you?
Episode 1,sansa stark,Would that be so terrible?
Episode 1,jon snow,"Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms--"
Episode 1,sansa stark,What does she want?
Episode 1,jon snow,Come to King's Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.
Episode 1,sansa stark,"You've been so consumed with the enemy to the north, you've forgotten about the one to the south."
Episode 1,jon snow,"I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him. And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too."
Episode 1,sansa stark,We still have a wall between us and the Night King. Theres nothing between us and Cersei.
Episode 1,jon snow,There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. They've never ranged this far north.
Episode 1,sansa stark,"You're the military man, but I know her. If you're her enemy, she'll never stop until she's destroyed you. Everyone who's ever crossed her, she's found a way to murder."
Episode 1,jon snow,You almost sound as if you admire her.
Episode 1,sansa stark,I learned a great deal from her.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,What is this?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"Its what we've been waiting for our whole lives. It's what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not."
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"He knew it. Made me memorize every damn city, town, lake, forest, and mountain."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"It's ours now, we just have to take it."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,You've been quiet since you came home. Are you angry with me?
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"No, not angry."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Are you afraid of me?
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Should I be?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand. Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her father's throne. Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel. He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada. Where will they land?"
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Dragonstone.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"They have deep-water ports for the ships. Stannis left the castle unoccupied, and that's where she was born."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Enemies to the east.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Enemies to the south--Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"Enemies to the west--Olenna, the old cunt. Another traitor."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Enemies to the north. Ned Stark's bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him. Enemies everywhere. We're surrounded by traitors. You're in command of the Lannister army now. How do we proceed?
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"Winter is here. We can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses. The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"If they think Daenerys will win. No one wants to fight on the losing side. Right now, we look like the losing side."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"Three kingdoms, at best. I'm not sure you understand how much danger we're in."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,I understand we're in a war for survival. I understand whoever loses dies. I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,A dynasty for whom? Our children are dead. We're the last of us.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"A dynasty for us, then."
Episode 1,jaime lannister,We never talked about Tommen.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,There's nothing to say.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Our baby boy killed himself.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"He betrayed me. He betrayed us both. Should we spend our days mourning the dead--mother, father, and all our children?"
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Cersei--
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"I loved them. I did. But they're ashes now and we're still flesh and blood. We're the last Lannisters, the last ones who count."
Episode 1,jaime lannister,Even Lannisters can't survive without allies. Where are our allies now? You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,I heard. How could we ever trust a man like that?
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"We couldn't. He was a useless, old coward, but the Freys supported us. Now they're all dead. Whoever killed them is no friend of ours. We need allies. Stronger, better allies. We can't win this war alone."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,You think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing?
Episode 1,jaime lannister,The Greyjoys? You invited the Greyjoys to King's Landing?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Not all of them.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"Well, it looks like all of them."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"I invited Euron Greyjoy, the new King of the Iron Islands. You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies. There you are."
Episode 1,jaime lannister,How are they better allies? How are they different from the Freys? They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"So does everyone when it suits them. Unlike the Freys, they have ships. And they're good at killing."
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"They're not good at anything. I know the Ironborn. They're bitter, angry little people. All they know how to do is steal things they can't build or grow themselves."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"Oh, what did he come here for, then?"
Episode 1,cersei lannister,A queen.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"You're not a rightful monarch, though, are you?"
Episode 1,jaime lannister,"The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated. Come to mention it, weren't you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet? You certainly caught us there. Very smart move on your part. Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway. I was there."
Episode 1,jaime lannister,The people I was cutting down were your own kin.
Episode 1,jaime lannister,And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,If not the most humble.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,What do you want in return?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,I decline your proposal.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,You're not trustworthy. You've broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity. You murdered your own brother.
Episode 1,sam,"Archmaester, I was wondering..."
Episode 1,sam,"Um, 147."
Episode 1,sam,I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.
Episode 1,sam,"I asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North, if I could have access to the restricted area of the library."
Episode 1,sam,No.
Episode 1,sam,"Archmaester, with respect, I've seen them--the Army of the Dead. The white walkers. W was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place."
Episode 1,sam,Sources in the restricted area?
Episode 1,sam,"So, you believe me."
Episode 1,sam,That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.
Episode 1,brienne,Nope.
Episode 1,sansa stark,"What do you want, Lord Baelish?"
Episode 1,sansa stark,"I am safe. I'm at home, surrounded by friends. I have Brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me."
Episode 1,sansa stark,"At the moment, peace and quiet."
Episode 1,sansa stark,"No need to seize the last word, Lord Baelish. I'll assume it was something clever."
Episode 1,brienne,Why is he still here?
Episode 1,sansa stark,"We need his men. Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton would still hold this castle. Littlefinger saved us."
Episode 1,brienne,He wants something.
Episode 1,sansa stark,I know exactly what he wants.
Episode 1,arya stark,That's a pretty song. I've never heard it before.
Episode 1,arya stark,I don't want to steal your food.
Episode 1,arya stark,King's Landing.
Episode 1,arya stark,"Not so bad, is it?"
Episode 1,arya stark,What are you doing in the Riverlands?
Episode 1,arya stark,"Oh, no, I couldn't. You don't have enough."
Episode 1,arya stark,"You're a long way from home. I'm sure you've had some adventures, though."
Episode 1,arya stark,Boy or girl?
Episode 1,arya stark,Why?
Episode 1,arya stark,It's really good.
Episode 1,arya stark,I'm going to kill the queen.
Episode 1,sam,The dead don't.
Episode 1,sam,The Targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons without even knowing what the First Men used it for.
Episode 1,sam,It's a map of Dragonstone. The Targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded Westeros.
Episode 1,sam,"A mountain of it. Beneath the ground. Stannis told me, but I didn't think... This is important. Jon needs to know."
Episode 1,jorah mormont,Has she come yet?
Episode 1,sam,Who?
Episode 1,jorah mormont,The Dragon Queen. Daenerys Stormborn.
Episode 1,sam,Haven't heard anything.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Shall we begin?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"On a night like this, you came into the world."
Episode 2,varys,I remember that storm. All the dogs in King's Landing howled through the night.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,I wish I could remember it.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,I always thought this would be a homecoming. It doesn't feel like home.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Good.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Not so many lions.
Episode 2,varys,"Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms. The lord of Westeros despise her. Even before your arrival, they plotted against her. Now..."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health?
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Conquering Westeros would be easy for you. But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,No.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse. If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won. With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,I never properly thanked you for that.
Episode 2,varys,"They joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?"
Episode 2,varys,I did.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,And then you served the man who overthrew him?
Episode 2,varys,"I had a choice, Your Grace--serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,But you didn't serve him long. You turned against him.
Episode 2,varys,"Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure. There have been few rulers in history as cruel as the Mad King. Robert was neither mad nor cruel. He simply had no interest in being king."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who--"
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"Before I came to power, you favored my brother. All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?"
Episode 2,varys,"Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace, I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.
Episode 2,varys,Which you turned to your advantage.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Who gave the order to kill me?
Episode 2,varys,King Robert.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Who hired the assassins?
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?
Episode 2,varys,"Your Grace, I did what had to be done to--"
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,To keep yourself alive.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that?"
Episode 2,varys,"The kind the realm needs. Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them. I wasn't born into a great house. I came from nothing. I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering. When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie? Not with any king or queen, but with the people. The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule. The people whose hearts you aim to win. If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes. Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me. But if you let me live, I will serve you well. I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you. Because I know the people have no better chance than you."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"Swear this to me, Varys. If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back. You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them."
Episode 2,varys,"I swear it, my queen."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"And I swear this--if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive."
Episode 2,varys,I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen. You are very welcome here. What is your name?
Episode 2,varys,"She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne. It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?"
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,We've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"The Lord of Light doesn't have many followers in Westeros, does he?"
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,What does your Lord expect from me?
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,The prince who was promised will bring the dawn. I'm afraid I'm not a prince.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?"
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"No, but I like it better."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,And you believe this prophecy refers to me?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Jon Snow? Ned Stark's bastard?
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,You know him?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.
Episode 2,varys,"And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is?"
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,He sounds like quite a man.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally. The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother. Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Very well. Send a raven north. Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone...and bend the knee.
Episode 2,sansa stark,Do you think it's really Tyrion? It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.
Episode 2,jon snow,Read the last bit.
Episode 2,sansa stark,"All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes."" What does that mean?"
Episode 2,jon snow,It's something he said to me the first night we met. You know him better than any of us. What do you think?
Episode 2,sansa stark,"Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters. He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk. ""The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne. Join us. Together we can end her tyranny."""
Episode 2,davos,"Sounds like a charmer. Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied and three dragons, a bit less charming."
Episode 2,jon snow,What?
Episode 2,davos,"Fire kills Whites, you told me. What breathes fire?"
Episode 2,sansa stark,You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?
Episode 2,davos,"No, too dangerous."
Episode 2,jon snow,But?
Episode 2,davos,"But if the Army of the Dead makes it passed the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?"
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it. Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell. But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown. With their help the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores. Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts. Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought. This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"You all remember the Mad King. You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people. His daughter is no different. In Essos her brutality is already legendary. She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay. And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will but I need your help, My Lords. We must stand together, all of us, if we hope to stop her."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Lord Tarley.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"Rickon, isn't it?"
Episode 2,jaime lannister,That's it.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Thank you for coming. The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance now more than ever. They might not have come if you hadn't.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Do you ride for Hornhill today?
Episode 2,jaime lannister,And what side will you be fighting for? You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle. Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could --
Episode 2,jaime lannister,I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come. I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies. All of her enemies.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"You swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"She was a great woman, once. Now she's broken. She wants revenge so badly she brought the Dothraki to our shores. The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history. I know you don't like my sister, but you have to make a choice. Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs?"
Episode 2,jaime lannister,When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south. I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley.
Episode 2,jorah mormont,How long?
Episode 2,jorah mormont,But how long 'till...
Episode 2,jorah mormont,Jorah. Jorah Mormont.
Episode 2,jorah mormont,There's no need. I've been dead to them for years.
Episode 2,cersei lannister,"No, I can't say I have. I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room."
Episode 2,cersei lannister,They were his trophies. He couldn't keep them around. They would have made him look small. Sometimes he would come down here and look at them. I believe he brought his whores on occasion.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I know how you wage war. We don't poison little girls here. Myrcella was innocent.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,That's enough. Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen. You will treat him with respect.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,I am not here to be queen of the ashes.
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,"That's very nice to hear. Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter. The common people loved her, the nobles loved her. And what is left of her now? Ashes. Commoners, nobles, they're all just children really. They won't obey you unless they fear you."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council. I'm grateful to all of you. But you have chosen to follow me. I will not attack King's Landing. We will not attack King's Landing."
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne? By asking nicely?
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides. Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country. If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point. Our army should be Westerosi."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,You are.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army. Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,"So, your master plan is to use our armies? Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?"
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,The unsullied will have another objective. For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros. And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock. Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Do I have your support?
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you all. Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?"
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me. But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros.
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,"Peace. Do you think that's what we had under your father or his father or his? Peace never lasts, my dear. Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman?"
Episode 2,olenna tyrell,"He's a clever man, your Hand. I've known a great many clever men. I've outlived them all. Do you know why? I ignored them. The lords of Westeros are sheep. Are you a sheep? No. You're a dragon. Be a dragon."
Episode 2,jorah mormont,What are you doing?
Episode 2,jorah mormont,What is it?
Episode 2,jorah mormont,Have you ever done this before?
Episode 2,arya stark,"Hello, Hot Pie. Sit down. Who's that for?"
Episode 2,arya stark,Mmm. This is good.
Episode 2,arya stark,I didn't do that.
Episode 2,arya stark,One or two.
Episode 2,arya stark,Big lady?
Episode 2,arya stark,She found me.
Episode 2,arya stark,You got any ale?
Episode 2,arya stark,King's Landing.
Episode 2,arya stark,I heard Cersei's queen now.
Episode 2,arya stark,Hmm.
Episode 2,arya stark,Cersei would do that.
Episode 2,arya stark,Why would I go there? The Boltons have it.
Episode 2,arya stark,What?
Episode 2,arya stark,You're lying.
Episode 2,arya stark,Thanks for the pie.
Episode 2,arya stark,Thanks.
Episode 2,arya stark,"Take care of yourself, Hot Pie. Try not to get killed."
Episode 2,jon snow,Come in.
Episode 2,jon snow,This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley. He was my brother at the Night's Watch. A man I trust as much as anyone in this world. He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass.
Episode 2,jon snow,I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone. It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.
Episode 2,jon snow,"He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen. She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister. She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons."
Episode 2,jon snow,Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept.
Episode 2,jon snow,"We need this Dragonglass, My Lords. We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army. We need to mine it and turn it into weapons."
Episode 2,jon snow,"But more importantly, we need allies. The Night King's army grows larger by the day. We can't defeat them on our own. We don't have the numbers. Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire. I need to try and persuade her to fight with us. Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone."
Episode 2,sansa stark,Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather? The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive.
Episode 2,jon snow,I know that.
Episode 2,sansa stark,"She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms. The north is one of those seven kingdoms. This isn't an invitation, it's a trap."
Episode 2,jon snow,"It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that. You know him. He's a good man."
Episode 2,jon snow,"You all crowned me your king. I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home. It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds. But the odds are against us. None of you have seen the Army of the Dead. None of you. We can never hope to defeat them alone. We need allies, powerful allies. I know it's a risk. But I have to take it."
Episode 2,sansa stark,Then send an emissary. Don't go yourself.
Episode 2,jon snow,Daenerys is a queen. Only a king can convince her to help us. It has to be me.
Episode 2,sansa stark,You're abandoning your people. Your abandoning your home.
Episode 2,jon snow,I'm leaving both in good hands.
Episode 2,sansa stark,Whose?
Episode 2,jon snow,"Yours. You are my sister. You are the only Stark in Winterfell. Until I return, the north is yours."
Episode 2,petyr baelish,I delivered his bones myself. I presented them to Lady Catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister. It seems like a lifetime ago. Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.
Episode 2,petyr baelish,"I was sorry when he died. Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much. So did I. She wasn't fond of you, was she? Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you. Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North. Last best hope against the coming storm."
Episode 2,jon snow,You don't belong down here.
Episode 2,petyr baelish,Forgive me. We have never talked properly. I wanted to remedy that.
Episode 2,jon snow,I have nothing to say to you.
Episode 2,petyr baelish,"Not even thank you? If it weren't for me you'd have been slaughtered at that battlefield. You have many enemies, My King, but I swear to you I'm not one of them. I love Sansa as I loved her mother."
Episode 2,jon snow,Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself.
Episode 2,arya stark,Nymeria?
Episode 2,arya stark,"Nymeria, it's me, Arya. I'm heading north, girl, back to Winterfell. I'm finally going home. Come with me."
Episode 2,arya stark,Come with me.
Episode 2,arya stark,That's not you.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,It's fine.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,Whatever my queen demands.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,The bastard of Winterfell.
Episode 3,jon snow,The dwarf of Casterly Rock.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,I believe we last saw each other on top of the wall.
Episode 3,jon snow,"You were pissing off the edge, if I remember right. You picked up some scars along the road."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,It's been a long road. But we're both still here.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,I'm Tyrion Lannister.
Episode 3,davos,Davos Seaworth.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,and DAVOS shake hands.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Ah, the Onion Knight. We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay."
Episode 3,davos,Unluckily for me.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor.
Episode 3,jon snow,Of course.
Episode 3,davos,Where are you from? I can't place the accent.
Episode 3,davos,Ah. I hear it's beautiful down there. Palm trees and butterflies. I haven't been myself.
Episode 3,davos,This place has changed.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"And Sansa, I hear she's alive and well."
Episode 3,jon snow,She is.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Does she miss me terribly?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,A sham marriage and unconsummated.
Episode 3,jon snow,I didn't ask --
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Well, it was. It wasn't. Anyway, she's much smarter than she lets on."
Episode 3,jon snow,She's starting to let on.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Good. At some point I want to hear how a Knight's Watch recruit became King in the North.
Episode 3,jon snow,As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"A long and bloody tale. To be honest, I was drunk for most of it."
Episode 3,jon snow,My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Of course they do. If I was your hand I would have advised against it. General rule of thumb, Stark men don't fare well when they travel south."
Episode 3,jon snow,True. But I'm not a Stark.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"I'd say you get used to them, but you never really do."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Come. Their mother is waiting for you.
Episode 3,varys,I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests. You begged us to summon the King in the North. Don't you want to see him again?
Episode 3,varys,Strange. You spoke so highly of Jon Snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff. I didn't take you for a bashful girl.
Episode 3,varys,"Oh, I doubt that. Give us common folk one taste of power we're like the lion who tasted man. Nothing is ever so sweet again."
Episode 3,varys,Why?
Episode 3,varys,So where will you go?
Episode 3,varys,"Good. If you don't mind my saying, I don't think you should return to Westeros. I'm not sure you'd be safe here."
Episode 3,varys,My Lady --
Episode 3,davos,This is Jon Snow.
Episode 3,davos,He's King in the North.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords. I hope the seas weren't too rough."
Episode 3,jon snow,"The winds were kind, Your Grace."
Episode 3,davos,"Apologies. I have a Flea Bottom accent, I know. But Jon Snow is King in the North, Your Grace. He's not a lord."
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Forgive me --
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth."
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"Forgive me, Ser Davos. I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen. Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity. But do I have my facts wrong?"
Episode 3,davos,"I wasn't there, Your Grace."
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"No. Of course not. But still, an oath is an oath. In perpetuity means -- what does perpetuity mean, Lord Tyrion?"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Forever.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"Forever. So I assume, My Lord, that you're here to bend the knee."
Episode 3,jon snow,I am not.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"Oh. Well, that is unfortunate. You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?"
Episode 3,jon snow,Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive. He burned my uncle alive. He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"My father was an evil man. On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family. And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father. Our two houses were allies for centuries. Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known. Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North. I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow. Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine. Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North. Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it."
Episode 3,jon snow,You're right. You're not guilty of your father's crime. And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Then why are you here?
Episode 3,jon snow,Because I need your help and you need mine.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?
Episode 3,jon snow,I did.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?"
Episode 3,jon snow,They're hard to miss.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"But still, I need your help?"
Episode 3,davos,"Not to defeat Cersei. You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall. Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Almost.
Episode 3,jon snow,But you haven't stormed King's Landing. Why not? The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people. It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it. Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help."
Episode 3,jon snow,"Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair."
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,You told me you liked this man.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,I do.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,I believe he's calling all of us children. Figure of speech.
Episode 3,jon snow,"Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north."
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north."
Episode 3,jon snow,I am not your enemy. The dead are the enemy.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,The dead?
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Is that another figure of speech?
Episode 3,jon snow,The Army of the Dead is on the march.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,The Army of the Dead?
Episode 3,jon snow,"You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"No, I don't think you're either of those things."
Episode 3,jon snow,The Army of the Dead is real. The White Walkers are real. The Knight King is real. I've seen them. If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --
Episode 3,jon snow,we're finished.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,I was born at Dragonstone. Not that I can remember it.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"We fled before Robert's assassins could find us. Robert was your father's best friend, no? I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib. Not that it matters now of course. I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me. I don't remember all of their names. I have been sold like a brood mare. I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen. The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea. Any sea."
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,They did for me. I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will.
Episode 3,jon snow,You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,The war against my sister has already begun. You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting --
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,whatever you saw beyond the wall.
Episode 3,davos,You don't believe him. I understand that. It sounds like nonsense.
Episode 3,davos,"But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North. You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros. He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen. He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He was named King in the North. Not because of his birthright. He has no birthright. He's a damn bastard. All those hard son's of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him."
Episode 3,davos,"All those things you don't believe in, he faced those things. He fought those things for the good of his people. He risked his life for his people. He took a knife in the heart for his people. He gave his own --"
Episode 3,davos,If we don't put asside our enmities and band together we will die. And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,If it doesn't matter you might as well kneel.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys. Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north.
Episode 3,jon snow,There's no time for that. There's no time for any of this. While we stand here debating --
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,It takes no time to bend the knee. Pledge your sword to her cause.
Episode 3,jon snow,And why would I do that?
Episode 3,jon snow,"I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you. As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name. And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King. The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them. And I will continue to do so as well as I can."
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"That's fair. It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms. By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion."
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,You must forgive my manners. You will both be tired after your long journey. We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.
Episode 3,jon snow,Am I your prisoner?
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Not yet.
Episode 3,varys,Our Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,And?
Episode 3,varys,Two or three ships escaped. The rest sunk our captured. Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured. The Greyjoys are dead or captured.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,All of them?
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,Euron has her.
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,I couldn't save her. I tried.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,You shall have what your heart desires --
Episode 3,cersei lannister,when the war is won.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country."
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike."
Episode 3,jaime lannister,Advice?
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"I want you to know I understand. Even though we're enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you. I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head. I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"The sound of your scream. I never heard a sound like that. I thought, that's true love. Oberyn looked beautiful that day. He really did. No one moved like him. No one had such skill with a spear. Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him. If only he hadn't taunted him. He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die. But that wasn't your lover's way, was it? Now he's burried somewhere. And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever. That must be difficult for you. When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child. I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse. I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms. I never got to have a mother. But Myrcella did. She was mine and you took her from me. Why did you do that?"
Episode 3,cersei lannister,It doesn't matter now.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"Your daughter is a beauty too. Brown eyes, those lips. A perfect Dornish beauty."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,I imagine she is your favorite.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites. But still, we're only human. We love who we love."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,I'm sorry. I can't understand you. The gag makes it difficult to understand what you're saying. It must be frustrating.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,We all make our choices. You chose to murder my daughter. You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"Do you feel powerful now? I don't sleep very well, not at all really. I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies. How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter. I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's. It would be poetic I suppose but fast. Too fast."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"She's so beautiful. The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, it's just not right."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"Qyburn, he's the cleverest man I know. Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella. The long goodbye, was that it?"
Episode 3,cersei lannister,That's the one.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,How long does the poison take?
Episode 3,cersei lannister,But death is certain?
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"Your daughter will die here in this cell. You will be here watching when she does. You will be here the rest of your days. If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat. You will live to watch your daughter rot, to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you've made."
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours. I don't want her to miss a thing.
Episode 3,jaime lannister,No.
Episode 3,jaime lannister,Don't.
Episode 3,jaime lannister,What are you doing? No one can see us like this ?
Episode 3,cersei lannister,I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms. I'll do as I please.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Good. And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,The Iron Bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,The Iron Bank wants its gold back.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,And we both know gold wins wars. Your vaults are empty. Your late husbando s profligacy saw to that.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,That's a fancy way of saying bet. The war has already begun. I've drawn first blood. I decapitated the Dornish snake. My armada owns the Narrow Sea.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.
Episode 3,cersei lannister,"Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think. Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl. You want to invest in her? I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade. How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?"
Episode 3,cersei lannister,From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch. In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?
Episode 3,cersei lannister,The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts. Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?
Episode 3,cersei lannister,Give me a fortnight. Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack. You're making it difficult. You look a lot better brooding than I do. You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.
Episode 3,jon snow,I'm a prisoner on this island.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island. You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want."
Episode 3,jon snow,Except to my ship. They took my ship.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,I wouldn't say we took your ship.
Episode 3,jon snow,I'm not playing word games with you. The dead are coming for us all.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men."
Episode 3,jon snow,It's hard for me to fathom. It really is. If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --
Episode 3,jon snow,You probably don't believe me.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,I do actually.
Episode 3,jon snow,You didn't before. Grumpkins and snarks you called them. Do you remember? You said it was all nonsense.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"It was all nonsense. Everybody knew it. But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows."
Episode 3,jon snow,How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Good question.
Episode 3,jon snow,I know it's a good question. I'm looking for an answer.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"People's minds aren't made for problems that large. White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister."
Episode 3,jon snow,I need to help prepare my people for what's coming. I can't help them from here. I'd like to leave.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.
Episode 3,jon snow,"Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes. Don't go south. Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader. And here I am. A northern fool."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us. And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye. Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't. Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now. While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter. She protects people from monsters, just as you do. That's why she came here. And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting. That's not a reasonable thing to ask."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,So do you have anything reasonable to ask?
Episode 3,jon snow,What do you mean?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Maybe you are a northern fool. I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Dragonglass?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Yes. Volcanic glass, obsidian. He says you have a tremendous amount of it here."
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Why are we talking about glass? We just lost two of our allies.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally."
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them. I'm unsure of the nomenclature."
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it."
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Which wise man said this?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,I don't remember.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"I would never do that...to you. The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here. All of his advisors would have told him not to come. I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway. You don't have to believe him. Let him mine the Dragonglass. If he's wrong it's worthless. You didn't even know it was here. It's nothing to you. Give him something by giving him nothing. Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally. Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand. Casterly Rock."
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people? Did you notice that?
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,You must allow them their flights of fancy. It's dreary in the north.
Episode 3,jon snow,Amazing thing to see.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon. They're both gone now.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,You lost two brothers as well?
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are. Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.
Episode 3,jon snow,You've been talking to Tyrion?
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,He is my Hand.
Episode 3,jon snow,He enjoys talking.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,We all enjoy what we're good at.
Episode 3,jon snow,I don't.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.
Episode 3,jon snow,I never expected that you would.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.
Episode 3,jon snow,I haven't either.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it. Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.
Episode 3,jon snow,Thank you.
Episode 3,jon snow,So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"You better get to work, Jon Snow."
Episode 3,sansa stark,How much do we have?
Episode 3,sansa stark,What does that mean?
Episode 3,sansa stark,What's the longest winter in the past 100 years?
Episode 3,sansa stark,"You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell."
Episode 3,sansa stark,"We must prepare for that eventuality. Every direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be. We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north. If we don't use it by winter's end we'll give it back to them, but if the entire north has to flee to Winterfell there won't be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them."
Episode 3,sansa stark,"Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?"
Episode 3,sansa stark,Are they covering those breastplates in leather?
Episode 3,sansa stark,"Well, shouldn't they be once the real cold comes?"
Episode 3,petyr baelish,Command suits you. The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall.
Episode 3,sansa stark,So they should be.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,I know Cersei better than anyone here. If you turn your back on her --
Episode 3,sansa stark,You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.
Episode 3,petyr baelish,I only meant to say --
Episode 3,sansa stark,"That the woman who murdered my mother, father and brother is dangerous? Thank you for your wise council."
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"One of two things will happen. Either the dead will defeat the living, in which case all our troubles come to an end. Or life will win out. And what then?"
Episode 3,petyr baelish,"Don't fight in the north or the south. Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind. Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend, every possible series of events is happening all at once. Live that way and nothing will surprise you. Everything that happens will be something that you've seen before."
Episode 3,sansa stark,I wish Jon was here.
Episode 3,sansa stark,Your father's last living true born son. You're Lord of Winterfell.
Episode 3,sansa stark,I don't know what that means.
Episode 3,sansa stark,"Try, please, for me."
Episode 3,sansa stark,How do you know all of this?
Episode 3,sansa stark,I thought you were the three-eyed raven.
Episode 3,sansa stark,Bran --
Episode 3,sansa stark,"I have to go back inside, Bran."
Episode 3,jorah mormont,A bit. Less than before.
Episode 3,jorah mormont,I don't know anything about that. I just started feeling better. I assumed it was the rest that did it.
Episode 3,jorah mormont,And the climate.
Episode 3,jorah mormont,How bad is it?
Episode 3,jorah mormont,I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it. I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could. Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise. The only place for me is with her.
Episode 3,jorah mormont,I owe my life to her and you.
Episode 3,jorah mormont,Perhaps our paths will cross again?
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.
Episode 3,varys,"Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet. To send our remaining ships after him --"
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,But you'll have to go yourself. Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place. You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,"I wouldn't be alone. I'd have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal. What can anyone do to them?"
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,It's too great a risk. You're too important.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,What about Casterly Rock?
Episode 3,varys,The Unsullied will be there soon.
Episode 3,varys,A difficult situation. They know we're coming.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Yes. Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister. She will be ready.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,No one has ever taken the rock.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"The Lannister army is still the army my father built. Well trained and well provisioned. 10,000 men at least. They will see us coming."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,They will be ready.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,The fight up the walls will be hard. We'll be at a disadvantage. Many men will die.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Interesting thing about my father. He built our house up from near ruin. He built our army. He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn't build the sewers. That was beneath him. So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find. Me. He was right. I was low. The company I kept low, women mostly. They weren't welcome at the Rock. Father disapproved of that sort of behavior. I couldn't walk them through the front gates. I couldn't have them in my chambers. So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"No better place for low pursuits. Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"As a good friend of mine once said, ""give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch."""
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,And so it begins. They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces. They will be outnumbered. They will have less armor and fewer weapons.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"But as my sister's armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater. They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them. They will be fighting for you. And that is why they will triump."
Episode 3,olenna tyrell,It's done?
Episode 3,jaime lannister,It is.
Episode 3,olenna tyrell,And now the rains weep for our whores. Did we fight well?
Episode 3,jaime lannister,I suppose as well as can be expected.
Episode 3,olenna tyrell,It was never our forte. Golden roses indeed. Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore. Well, it is to me. My fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne."
Episode 3,olenna tyrell,So you'll just let them take it?
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"For now. They won't be able to hold it. Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left. Eventually they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros."
Episode 3,olenna tyrell,"And you took your army, your real army, and went where they weren't?"
Episode 3,jaime lannister,As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood. There are always lessons in failures.
Episode 3,olenna tyrell,Yes. You must be very wise by now.
Episode 3,jaime lannister,My father always said I was a slow learner.
Episode 3,olenna tyrell,"If he was so clever why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry? I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough. No more learning from my mistakes, eh? How will you do it? With that sword?"
Episode 3,olenna tyrell,"That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it? Not that he ever used it. What did he call it?"
Episode 3,jaime lannister,Widow's Wail.
Episode 3,olenna tyrell,"He really was a cunt, wasn't he? I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders. I never lost a night's sleep over them. They were necessary. And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did. But your sister has done things I wasn't capable of imagining. That was my prize mistake, a failure of imagination. She's a monster, you do know that?"
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"To you, sure. To others as well. But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?"
Episode 3,olenna tyrell,You love her. You really do love her. You poor fool. She'll be the end of you.
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"Possibly. Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?"
Episode 3,olenna tyrell,What better person to discuss it with? What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room? But perhaps you're right. If she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control.
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"Yes, it has."
Episode 3,olenna tyrell,She's a disease. I regret my role in spreading it. You will too.
Episode 3,jaime lannister,I think we're done here.
Episode 3,olenna tyrell,How will it happen?
Episode 3,jaime lannister,Cersei had several ideas. Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep. Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing. I talked her out of those.
Episode 3,olenna tyrell,Will there be pain?
Episode 3,jaime lannister,No. I made sure of that.
Episode 3,olenna tyrell,That's good.
Episode 3,olenna tyrell,"I'd hate to die like your son clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood red, skin purple. It must have been horrible for you as a Kingsguard, as a father. It was horrible enough for me. A shocking scene. Not at all what I intended. You see, I'd never seen the posion work before. Tell Cersei. I want her to know it was me."
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Halt that wagon!
Episode 4,jaime lannister,opens the carriage. It is filled with gold bars and coins. He picks up a large sack and hands it to BRONN.
Episode 4,bronn,You just won the biggest prize in the world. What could you possibly have to be upset about? Come on. You can tell me. Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.
Episode 4,bronn,There is no more High Septon.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"No, there isn't, is there?"
Episode 4,bronn,There is still the question of my prize.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,is putting a padlock on the wagon bearing the gold. He stops and turns to BRONN.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,That's a lot of money I just gave you.
Episode 4,bronn,It's not a castle.
Episode 4,bronn,turns and points to Highgarden.
Episode 4,bronn,How about that one? It's available.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,You don't want Highgarden.
Episode 4,bronn,I beg to differ.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"We're at war. Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in. Besides, think of the upkeep. The more you own, the more it weighs you down."
Episode 4,bronn,"Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh? All your new riches weighing you down?"
Episode 4,jaime lannister,pounds on the back of the carriage and the horses start trotting.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,They're not mine. The gold belongs to the Iron Bank. We pay our debts.
Episode 4,bronn,Right. Just not to me.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid. When we win this war all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you."
Episode 4,bronn,"Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign will be quiet and peaceful."
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Stranger things have happened.
Episode 4,bronn,Like what?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,The current harvest?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,looks over to BRONN.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?"
Episode 4,bronn,I'm not much for shoveling weight.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest, I've heard you guys have a real talent for that."
Episode 4,cersei lannister,and TYCHO NESTORIS from the Iron Bank of Braavos are sitting having a discussion.
Episode 4,cersei lannister,"You're too kind, My Lord."
Episode 4,cersei lannister,Is on its way. My brother is supervising its transportation himself.
Episode 4,cersei lannister,We must devise a way to raise their spirits.
Episode 4,cersei lannister,My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.
Episode 4,cersei lannister,"It will indeed. I need to expand my armies, my navies. My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos."
Episode 4,cersei lannister,That's good to hear. I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,This is for you.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,flips the knife in his hand and extends it towards BRAN.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat, but your mother fought him off."
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"The other dagger, the one that took her life, I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have. I wasn't there for her when she needed me most. But I am here for her now. To do what she would have done, to protect her children. Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask."
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"No. That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings. In a way, that dagger made you what you are today. Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall. I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe."
Episode 4,petyr baelish,hands the sheath of the knife to BRAN. BRAN slides the knife into the sheath.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"To go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world, I can only imagine --"
Episode 4,petyr baelish,"I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark."
Episode 4,petyr baelish,stands up to leave.
Episode 4,petyr baelish,bows and walks past Meera and closes the door.
Episode 4,arya stark,approaches the main gate on foot. Two guards are huddled by a brazier getting warm. There's indistinct chatter. One of the men notice ARYA walking to the gate and approach her.
Episode 4,arya stark,In there. I live here.
Episode 4,arya stark,I'm Arya Stark. This is my home.
Episode 4,arya stark,Send for Maester Llewyn or Ser Rodrick. They'll tell you who I am.
Episode 4,arya stark,"Go ask Jon Snow then, the King in the North. He's my brother"
Episode 4,arya stark,If Jon Snow is gone who is in charge of Winterfell?
Episode 4,arya stark,Which Lady Stark?
Episode 4,arya stark,Tell Sansa her sister is home.
Episode 4,arya stark,"I'm getting into this castle one way or another. If I'm not who I say I am, I won't last long. But if I am, and Sansa finds out that you turned me away..."
Episode 4,arya stark,keeps glancing at the men. They look uneasy. They bring her inside of the gate. They indicate towards a cart near the entrance.
Episode 4,arya stark,is glancing around Winterfell. Men are working building tools and cutting wood. ARYA looks over and sees a Winterfell flag sigil hanging from the wall. The two guards are still arguing.
Episode 4,sansa stark,sighs.
Episode 4,sansa stark,You don't have to. I know where she is.
Episode 4,arya stark,is standing look at a statue of Ned Stark holding his sword. ARYA hears a sound and turns to see SANSA approaching. SANSA stops when she sees ARYA.
Episode 4,arya stark,Do I have to call you Lady Stark now?
Episode 4,sansa stark,hesitates for a moment.
Episode 4,sansa stark,Yes.
Episode 4,sansa stark,begins smiling then walking towards ARYA. SANSA reaches out and hugs ARYA.
Episode 4,sansa stark,You shouldn't have run from the guards.
Episode 4,arya stark,I didn't run. You need better guards.
Episode 4,sansa stark,smirks at ARYA.
Episode 4,arya stark,"It suits you, Lady Stark. Jon left you in charge?"
Episode 4,sansa stark,"He did. I hope he comes back soon. I remember how happy he was to see me. When he sees you, his heart will probably stop."
Episode 4,arya stark,That doesn't look like him. It should have been carved by someone who knew his face.
Episode 4,sansa stark,Everyone who knew his face is dead.
Episode 4,arya stark,We're not.
Episode 4,arya stark,turns to face SANSA.
Episode 4,arya stark,They say you killed Joffrey. Did you?
Episode 4,sansa stark,I wish I had.
Episode 4,arya stark,Me too. I was angry when I heard someone else had done it. However long my list got he was always first.
Episode 4,sansa stark,Your list?
Episode 4,arya stark,Of people I'm going to kill.
Episode 4,sansa stark,begins to laugh. ARYA joins her.
Episode 4,sansa stark,How did you get back to Winterfell?
Episode 4,arya stark,It's a long story. I imagine yours is too.
Episode 4,sansa stark,Yes. It's not a very pleasant one.
Episode 4,arya stark,"Mine neither, but our stories aren't over yet."
Episode 4,sansa stark,"No, they're not."
Episode 4,sansa stark,"Arya, Bran's home too."
Episode 4,arya stark,smiles and looks at SANSA. SANSA doesn't smile back. The smile fades from ARYA's face.
Episode 4,arya stark,steps forward and throws her arms around BRAN. SANSA smiles in the background. ARYA lets go and steps back.
Episode 4,arya stark,You saw me?
Episode 4,sansa stark,Bran has visions.
Episode 4,arya stark,So did I.
Episode 4,sansa stark,Why would you go back there?
Episode 4,arya stark,stares at BRAN. ARYA turns to look at SANSA.
Episode 4,sansa stark,Who else is on your list?
Episode 4,arya stark,Most of them are dead already.
Episode 4,arya stark,Where did you get this?
Episode 4,arya stark,"Littlefinger, he's here?"
Episode 4,arya stark,turns to look at SANSA.
Episode 4,sansa stark,He's declared for House Stark.
Episode 4,sansa stark,steps up closer to BRAN and speaks to him.
Episode 4,sansa stark,Why would he give you a dagger?
Episode 4,sansa stark,Why?
Episode 4,sansa stark,The cutthroat after your fall?
Episode 4,arya stark,Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?
Episode 4,sansa stark,He's not a generous man. He wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back.
Episode 4,sansa stark,What do you mean it doesn't matter?
Episode 4,arya stark,Are you sure? It's Valyrian steel.
Episode 4,arya stark,looks down at the dagger. She steps forward and takes it from BRAN.
Episode 4,arya stark,is pushing BRAN in his wheelchair and SANSA is next to them. The Stark children are walking back through the gate of Winterfell. Men are milling around doing various jobs. BRIENNE and PODRICK see the Stark children all back at Winterfell together.
Episode 4,brienne,I did next to nothing.
Episode 4,brienne,I'm not a --
Episode 4,brienne,pauses for a moment.
Episode 4,brienne,"Thank you, Podrick."
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,and MISSANDEI are walking along a path outside of Dragonstone followed by members of the Queensguard.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Soon. They will come back to me.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,stops and turns to look at MISSANDEI. She then continues walking.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,What happened?
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Many things?
Episode 4,jon snow,Your Grace.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,looks at MISSANDEI then her Queensguard. She speaks in Valyrian and motions to her guard to stand down.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,It's all right.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,descends the stairs with MISSANDEI and they begin walking with JON. They walk along the beach until they reach a cave. DAVOS is waiting for them with a lit torch.
Episode 4,jon snow,I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.
Episode 4,jon snow,leads DAENERYS and MISSANDEI into the cave. He lights a brazier and illuminates the Dragonglass along the walls. He continues walking deeper into the cave.
Episode 4,jon snow,"So this is it, all we'll ever need."
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,is looking up at the walls of Dragonglass.
Episode 4,jon snow,"There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace."
Episode 4,jon snow,and DAENERYS go to a further chamber in the cave. There are murals painted on the walls of Dragonglass.
Episode 4,jon snow,The Children of the Forest made these.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,When?
Episode 4,jon snow,A very long time ago.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,They were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters. Maybe even before there were men.
Episode 4,jon snow,No.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,stops looking at the walls and turns to look at JON. JON walks to another wall and begins to examine the murals. The murals depict Children of the Forest and the First Men standing together.
Episode 4,jon snow,They were here together the Children and the First Men.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Doing what? Fighting each other?
Episode 4,jon snow,takes DAENERYS by the arm and swings her torch to another part of the wall. There is a mural of the Night King and White Walkers.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"They fought together against their common enemy. Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together. We need to do the same if we're going to survive."
Episode 4,jon snow,and DAENERYS look back at the wall with the Night King.
Episode 4,jon snow,Because the enemy is real. It's always been real.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,turns to look at JON.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?
Episode 4,jon snow,"No, I don't think I can."
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,steps forward closer to JON.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,I will fight for you. I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee.
Episode 4,jon snow,"My people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered."
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,steps even closer to JON until they're face to face.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,They will if their king does. They chose you to lead them. They chose you to protect them. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?
Episode 4,jon snow,"and DAENERYS, DAVOS and MISSANDEI are walking out of the cave. As they exit TYRION and VARYS are standing on the beach awaiting them. DAENERYS begins addressing Tyrion."
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,What is it?
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,We took Casterly Rock.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,That's very good to hear.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,and VARYS look at each other. They aren't eager to deliver the bad news.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Isn't it?
Episode 4,davos,You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves. Perhaps --
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,You will stay. All my allies are gone. They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,We still have the largest army.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back. We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland. Commit to the blockade of King's Landing. We have a plan. It's still the right plan.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"stops walking, turns and speaks harshly to Tyrion."
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"The right plan? Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,If I've underestimated our enemies --
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"Our enemies? Your family, you mean. Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all."
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,begins looking out to the ocean. Three dragons are flying in the sky over the water.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Enough with the clever plans.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,turns back and looks at TYRION.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,I have three large dragons. I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,We've discussed this.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,My enemies are in the Red Keep. What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,A smart one.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,looks over to JON SNOW.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,What do you think I should do?
Episode 4,jon snow,I would never presume to --
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,I'm at war. I'm losing.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,begins walking close to JON.
Episode 4,jon snow,looks over the ocean at the dragons flying.
Episode 4,jon snow,I never thought that dragons would exist again. No one did. The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen. Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen. Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.
Episode 4,jon snow,glances back towards the dragons.
Episode 4,jon snow,"But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different. You're just more of the same."
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,looks back out to her dragons flying along the water.
Episode 4,brienne,and PODRICK are sparring. BRIENNE kicks PODS foot out from under him and he lands face first in the dirt.
Episode 4,brienne,Don't lunge.
Episode 4,brienne,Don't go where your enemy leads you.
Episode 4,arya stark,is watching the sparring session from across the courtyard. She begins to approach Brienne.
Episode 4,brienne,Up.
Episode 4,brienne,begins striking at PODRICK while he blocks her blows. BRIENNE hits PODRICK in the stomach with the hilt of her sword and PODRICK lands on the ground.
Episode 4,brienne,And don't --
Episode 4,arya stark,Don't fight someone like her in the first place.
Episode 4,brienne,Nice sword. Very nice dagger.
Episode 4,arya stark,looks down at the Valyrian dagger and unsheathes it. She approaches BRIENNE flipping the knife several times in her fingers. BRIENNE takes the dagger and examines it.
Episode 4,sansa stark,and BAELISH are walking along the upper section of the courtyard having a conversation.
Episode 4,sansa stark,If they haven't contributed the right amount of grain to the stores then I'm afraid they'll have to make due with --
Episode 4,sansa stark,sees ARYA in the courtyard speaking with BRIENNE and stops to watch her.
Episode 4,arya stark,It's been awhile since I've trained.
Episode 4,brienne,"I can go and find the Master of Arms for you, My Lady."
Episode 4,arya stark,He didn't beat the hound. You did. I want to train with you.
Episode 4,brienne,chuckles.
Episode 4,arya stark,"You swore to serve both of my mother's daughters, didn't you?"
Episode 4,brienne,nods her head in agreement.
Episode 4,brienne,"Move aside, Podrick."
Episode 4,brienne,"You can't use that, My Lady. It's too small."
Episode 4,arya stark,I won't cut you. Don't worry.
Episode 4,brienne,smirks and raises her sword to a fighting posture.
Episode 4,brienne,I'll try not to.
Episode 4,brienne,"strikes at ARYA who quickly sidesteps and parries the attack. BRIENNE attacks again and ARYA sidesteps, dodges multiple strikes and parries BRIENNE while smiling. ARYA strikes at BRIENNE and hits her hand causing BRIENNE to flinch and lose her two-handed grip on her sword. BRIENNE regains composure and starts to circle ARYA. BAELISH and SANSA are still watching from the upper balcony. ARYA is waiting for an attack with her sword behind her back. BRIENNE strikes and ARYA blocks her attacks, spins and stabs behind her back and hits BRIENNE in the knee causing BRIENNE's sword to strike the dirt. BRIENNE kicks ARYA in the stomach and sends ARYA to the ground. ARYA quickly gets back to her feet. BRIENNE overpowers ARYA and ARYA drops her sword on the ground. BRIENNE strikes again but ARYA dodges, draws her Valyrian dagger and puts it near BRIENNE's neck. BRIENNE and ARYA both stop fighting and sheathe their weapons smiling."
Episode 4,brienne,Who taught you to do that?
Episode 4,arya stark,No one.
Episode 4,arya stark,collects her sword. SANSA walks away. BAELISH remains on the balcony staring at ARYA who looks up at him. BAELISH bows to ARYA and walks away.
Episode 4,jon snow,and DAVOS are walking along the paths outside of Dragonstone having a discussion.
Episode 4,davos,What do you think of her?
Episode 4,jon snow,Who?
Episode 4,davos,sighs
Episode 4,davos,I believe you know of whom I speak.
Episode 4,jon snow,I think she has a good heart.
Episode 4,davos,A good heart? I've noticed you starring at that good heart.
Episode 4,jon snow,"There's no time for that. I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes. How many men do we have in the north to fight him? 10,000? Less?"
Episode 4,davos,Fewer.
Episode 4,jon snow,What?
Episode 4,davos,and JON near the end of the path. MISSANDEI is standing along the path looking at the ocean.
Episode 4,davos,"Speaking of good hearts, Missandei of Naarth."
Episode 4,davos,"King Snow, isn't it? No? That doesn't sound right. King Jon?"
Episode 4,jon snow,It doesn't matter.
Episode 4,jon snow,Of course.
Episode 4,jon snow,I'm a bastard. My mother and father weren't married.
Episode 4,davos,Is the custom different in Naarth?
Episode 4,davos,The sounds liberating.
Episode 4,jon snow,Why did you leave your homeland?
Episode 4,jon snow,I'm sorry.
Episode 4,davos,"If I may, how did a slave girl come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?"
Episode 4,davos,"That was good of her. Of course you're serving her now, aren't you?"
Episode 4,jon snow,And if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow --
Episode 4,jon snow,You believe that?
Episode 4,davos,You'll forgive me if I switch sides.
Episode 4,jon snow,notices a single ship sailing into the bay. It has a kraken sigil. MISSANDEI turns to look.
Episode 4,jon snow,Is that a Greyjoy ship?
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,"GREYJOY and other Iron Born are pulling their landing boat onto the beach wading through the surf. They pull the boat onto the sand. JON SNOW, MISSANDEI, DAVOS and Dothraki guards are waiting to meet them. JON sees THEON and both men freeze and stare at each other. JON steps forward towards THEON."
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,Jon. I didn't know you were here.
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,steps closer to JON.
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,"Sansa, is she all right?"
Episode 4,jon snow,grabs THEON by his shirt and pulls him face to face.
Episode 4,jon snow,What you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you.
Episode 4,jon snow,releases THEON.
Episode 4,davos,We heard your uncle attacked your fleet. We thought you were dead.
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,I should be.
Episode 4,davos,Your sister?
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,Euron has her. I came to ask the queen to help get her back.
Episode 4,jon snow,The queen is gone.
Episode 4,theon greyjoy,Where did she go?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Good.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,We are stretched a bit thin.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Let's give them fair warning first. These men fought well at Highgarden.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Rickon.
Episode 4,bronn,openly laughs in DICKON's face and looks at JAIME.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden. Your first battle?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,And?
Episode 4,bronn,Come on. Your father's not here.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,They didn't deserve to die. But Lady Olenna chose to betray the queen and support the Targaryen girl. So here we are.
Episode 4,bronn,Men shit themselves when they die. Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?
Episode 4,jaime lannister,looks over at BRONN
Episode 4,bronn,"Well, I learned it when I was 5."
Episode 4,bronn,pauses and strains to hear a noise far in the distance.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,What?
Episode 4,bronn,Listen.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Spears and shields! Spears and shields!
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Spears and shields!
Episode 4,bronn,In line now!
Episode 4,bronn,Get back to King's Landing.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,I'm not abandoning my army.
Episode 4,bronn,"You're a commander, not a damned infantryman. These fuckers are about to swamp us."
Episode 4,jaime lannister,We can hold them off.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Dracarys!
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Hold the line!
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Archers! Archers with me!
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Knock!
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Loose!
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Qyburn's scorpion is over there.
Episode 4,bronn,Go get it then.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,I can't shoot with one hand.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,holds up his gold hand to illustrate his point.
Episode 4,bronn,hesitates for a moment. He turns his horse and rides to man the artillery crossbow. JAIME draws his sword and rides into battle.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Come on!
Episode 4,bronn,Where are you?
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,walks to the edge of the battlefield accompanied by Dothraki guards. He can see Lannisters being slaughtered. One of the Dothraki guards begin to speak.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,is watching the mayhem. Men are screaming and engulfed in flames. Horses and carriages run wild with no driver. JAIME is still on the battlefield struggling against the horde. Burning Lannister men are taking off their helmets revealing melted faces. Men crawl to the river in search of relief from the dragonfire. DROGON and DAENERYS are flying over the river creating wake in the water. JAIME sees her approaching his position.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,Take cover!
Episode 4,bronn,Come on you fucker.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,commands DROGON to fire at the crossbow.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Flee, you idiot!"
Episode 4,jaime lannister,looks at DAENERYS and readies himself. He spurs his horse onward.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"Come on, boy. Come on!"
Episode 4,jaime lannister,grabs the spear as he rides by and brings it up to position. JAIME's horse is galloping full speed on the edge of the river kicking up water. TYRION is watching JAIME's attempt to kill DAENERYS.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,You fucking idiot.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"is getting close. DAENERYS turns at the last moment to see JAIME bearing down on her spear in hand. DROGON notices JAIME, turns his head and spews flames. BRONN appears from nowhere and manages to dive off of his horse and knock JAIME and himself in the water before they're both consumed by fire. Their horses are instantly burned to death. JAIME is being dragged down by a full set of armor into the dark water. JAIME sinks into blackness and out of sight."
Episode 5,jaime lannister,You could have killed me.
Episode 5,bronn,What the fuck were you doing back there?
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Ending the war by killing her.
Episode 5,bronn,You saw the dragon between you and her?
Episode 5,bronn,looks incredulously at JAIME.
Episode 5,bronn,And?
Episode 5,jaime lannister,sits up and says nothing to BRONN. BRONN sits up and faces JAIME.
Episode 5,bronn,"Listen to me, cunt. Till I get what I'm owed, a dragon doesn't get to kill you. You don't get to kill you. Only I get to kill you."
Episode 5,jaime lannister,"That was only one of them. She has two more. If she decides to use them, to really use them --"
Episode 5,bronn,You're fucked.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Don't you mean we're fucked?
Episode 5,bronn,"No, I do not. Dragons are where our partnership ends. I'm not going to be around when those things start spitting fire on King's Landing."
Episode 5,jaime lannister,I have to tell Cersei.
Episode 5,bronn,pauses and looks at JAIME.
Episode 5,bronn,Best well jump back in that river.
Episode 5,bronn,stands up and walks away. JAIME continues sitting on the shore looking at the smoke and fire from the distant battle.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,is walking over an ash covered ground. There are burned bodies and cargo strewn about. Dothraki are looting dead Lannister soldies. A group of mounted Dothraki are escorting captured Lannister soldiers to where DAENERYS and DROGON are awaiting the prisoners. DAENERYS addresses the captured soldiers.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"I know what Cersei has told you, that I've come to destroy your cities --"
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"burn down your homes, murder you and orphan your children. That's Cersei Lannister, not me. I'm not here to murder. And all I want to destroy is the wheel that is rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world. I offer you a choice. Bend the knee and join me. Together we will leave the world a better place than we found it, or refuse and die."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"Step forward, My Lord."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,You will not kneel?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"My sister, she wasn't your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time. So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,You will not trade your honor for your life. I respect that.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,turns to speak to DAENERYS.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"Perhaps he could take the black, Your Grace. Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier. He would be invaluable at the Wall."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,turns to look at her Dothraki escort. The Dothraki walk forward to collect RANDYLL. As the men are pulling RANDYLL away DICKON steps forward.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,Who are you?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,You are the future of your house. This war has already wiped one great house from the world. Don't let it happen again. Bend the knee.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,turns to speak to DAENERYS. He speaks softly so no one but the queen can hear.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,I meant what I said. I'm not here to put men in chains. If that becomes an option many will take it. I gave them a choice. They made it.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families --"
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,I'm not beheading anyone.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,pauses and looks over the DROGON. DRGON roars and shakes his head and flexes his wings.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Your Grace --
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,looks to her Dothraki escort and gives a signal. The men grab RANDYLL and DICKON and walk them over to DROGON. RANDYLL takes DICKON by the arm.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,pauses a moment and looks at RANDYLL and DICKON.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,Dracarys.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,"is quickly walking down the hall leading to CERSEI's room. As he approaches, QYBURN exits the queen's chambers."
Episode 5,jaime lannister,passes by QYBURN without saying a word and barges into CERSEI's quarters. CERSEI stand and walks over to JAIME.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,How many men did we lose?
Episode 5,jaime lannister,We haven't done a full counting.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"It's armies that win wars. We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us. We can buy mercenaries."
Episode 5,jaime lannister,shakes his head.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"They're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be."
Episode 5,jaime lannister,"I just saw the Dothraki fight. They'll beat any mercenary army. They'll beat any army I've ever seen. Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport. Her dragon burned a thousand wagons. Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you. They couldn't stop it. And she has three of them. This isn't a war we can win."
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"So what do we do? Sue for peace? I sit on her father's throne, the father you betrayed and murdered. And in her mind she's winning. What sort of offer do you think she'd make?"
Episode 5,cersei lannister,turns and walks away from JAIME.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,He didn't.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"You saw the crossbow, you saw his body."
Episode 5,jaime lannister,walks across the room to where CERSEI is standing.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,I'm not talking about father. Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey. He had nothing to do with it.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,After all this time it still amazes me --
Episode 5,jaime lannister,It was Olenna. She confessed before she died.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?
Episode 5,jaime lannister,After.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,And you believed her?
Episode 5,jaime lannister,If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen? Which one would Margerey been better able to control? Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms? She was telling the truth.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"looks away, then sits down."
Episode 5,cersei lannister,I shouldn't have listened to you. She should have died screaming.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,"She's dead like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house. And if we don't find a way out of this war we'll follow them."
Episode 5,cersei lannister,So we fight and die or we submit and die. I know my choice. A soldier should know his.
Episode 5,jon snow,SNOW is standing on the edge of a cliff looking towards the ocean. DROGON roars and flies over him with DAENERYS on his back. DROGON lands next to JON and charges towards him. DROGON opens his jaws and roars in JON's face. DROGON creeps closer until he is inches from JON. JON removes his glove and slowly extends his hand toward DROGON. DROGON lowers his head and allows JON to touch him. DAENERYS looks surprised and steps down from her mount. DROGON turns and flies away.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"They're beautiful, aren't they?"
Episode 5,jon snow,"That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are. Gorgeous beasts."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"They're not beasts to me. No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, they're my children."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,turns to look at her three dragons as they fly over Dragonstone in the distance.
Episode 5,jon snow,You weren't gone long.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,turns back to JON.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,No.
Episode 5,jon snow,And?
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.
Episode 5,jon snow,pauses and doesn't say anything.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,You're not sure how you feel about that?
Episode 5,jon snow,"No, I'm not."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"turns and starts walking towards the castle, JON follows."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?
Episode 5,jon snow,Thousands.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,We both want to help people. We can only help them from a position of strength. Sometimes strength is terrible. When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.
Episode 5,jon snow,Ser Davos gets carried away.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,So it was a figure of speech?
Episode 5,jon snow,doesn't say anything. A group of Dothraki guards approach DAENERYS and speak in their native tongue.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,He is my friend.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,kneels before DAENERYS.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,Your Grace.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,stands.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend."
Episode 5,jon snow,I served with your father. He was a great man.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,nods to JON.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,You look strong. You found a cure?
Episode 5,jorah mormont,"I wouldn't be here if I hadn't. I return to your service, my queen, if you'll have me."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,It would be my honor.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,steps forward and hugs JORAH.
Episode 5,sam,stops working and turns around.
Episode 5,sam,turns to collect his work and leave. The maesters begin talking to one another.
Episode 5,varys,and TYRION are sitting on the stairs of the Throne Room alone. VARYS has a sealed raven scroll in his hand tapping it on the stone. TYRION is drinking a glass of wine having a discussion with VARYS.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,All rulers demand that people bend the knee. It's why they're rulers. She gave Tarley a choice. A man who had taken up arms against her. What else could she do?
Episode 5,varys,Not burn him alive alongside his son.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"I am her hand, not her head. I can't make her decisions for her."
Episode 5,varys,That's what I used to tell myself about her father. I found the traitors but I wasn't the one burning them alive. I was only a purveyor of information.
Episode 5,varys,"reaches over to TYRION's cup of wine, picks it up and begins to drink from it. He grimaces as he drinks."
Episode 5,varys,"It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy, ""I'm not the one doing it."" As the pitch of their screams rose higher, ""I'm not the one doing it."" When their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the Thone Room, ""I'm not the one doing it."""
Episode 5,varys,drinks again and sets the cup down next to TYRION. TYRION picks it up.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Daenerys is not her father.
Episode 5,varys,And she never will be... with the right counsel. You need to find a way to make her listen.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,looks down at the note in VARYS's hand.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Who is that for?
Episode 5,varys,Jon Snow.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Did you read it?
Episode 5,varys,It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,pauses and drinks from his cup of wine.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,What's it say?
Episode 5,varys,Nothing good.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,and VARYS are seated at the painted table. TYRION and JORAH stand near the queen. DAVOS and JON SNOW are standing on the other end of the table. JON is holding a raven scroll and reading it.
Episode 5,jon snow,I thought Arya was dead. I thought Bran was dead.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,I'm happy for you. You don't look happy.
Episode 5,jon snow,Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch. If they make it past the wall --
Episode 5,varys,The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years. Presumably --
Episode 5,jon snow,interrupts VARYS.
Episode 5,jon snow,I need to go home.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,You said you don't have enough men.
Episode 5,jon snow,We'll fight with the men we have. Unless you'll join us.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,And give the country to Cersei? As soon as I march away she marches in.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Perhaps not. Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children. What if we prove her wrong?
Episode 5,jon snow,I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,begins walking around the table closer to JON.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,So bring the dead to her.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,I thought that was what we are trying to avoid.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,We don't have to bring the whole army. Only one soldier.
Episode 5,davos,Is that possible?
Episode 5,jon snow,The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.
Episode 5,varys,Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,The only person she listens to is Jaime. He may listen to me.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,And how would you get into King's Landing.
Episode 5,davos,"I can smuggle you in, but if the Goldcloaks were to recognize you, I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,nods his head.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men."
Episode 5,varys,Fair point. How do you propose to find one?
Episode 5,jon snow,pauses and stares at the ground. JORAH breaks the silence.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,With the queen's permission I'll go north and take one.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,turns to look at JORAH.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you. Allow me to serve you.
Episode 5,jon snow,The free folk will help us. They know the real north better than anyone.
Episode 5,davos,They won't follow Ser Jorah.
Episode 5,jon snow,They won't have to.
Episode 5,davos,You can't lead a raid beyond the wall. You're not in the Night's Watch anymore. You're King in the North.
Episode 5,jon snow,I'm the only one here whose fought them. I'm the only one here who knows them.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,I haven't given you permission to leave.
Episode 5,jon snow,"With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission. I am a king. And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive. I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people. Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,pauses for a moment then nods her head in agreement.
Episode 5,sansa stark,"You're very kind, my lords, but Jon is our king. He is doing what he thinks is best."
Episode 5,sansa stark,and ARYA are walking through the hall to SANSA's quarters having a discussion.
Episode 5,sansa stark,I warned Jon this would happen. He can't leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.
Episode 5,arya stark,He didn't. He trusted you to hold it for him.
Episode 5,sansa stark,"Well, he's not making it easy. The northern lords are proud."
Episode 5,arya stark,These are mother and father's chambers.
Episode 5,sansa stark,And?
Episode 5,arya stark,Nothing.
Episode 5,sansa stark,Don't do that.
Episode 5,sansa stark,turns around to face ARYA.
Episode 5,arya stark,What?
Episode 5,sansa stark,Say what you mean.
Episode 5,arya stark,You always liked nice things. It made you feel better than everyone.
Episode 5,sansa stark,drops the papers in her hand on a table and looks at ARYA.
Episode 5,sansa stark,Are you angry with me?
Episode 5,arya stark,They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened.
Episode 5,sansa stark,"I listened to their complaints, which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell."
Episode 5,arya stark,Their opinions are important to you?
Episode 5,sansa stark,"Glover has 500 men. Royce has 2,000. Offend them and Jon loses his army."
Episode 5,arya stark,Not if they lose their heads first.
Episode 5,sansa stark,"Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands. We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale, all of us working together. Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but that's not the way you get people to work together."
Episode 5,arya stark,"And if Jon doesn't come back, you'll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want."
Episode 5,sansa stark,How can you even think such a horrible thing?
Episode 5,arya stark,"You're thinking it right now. You don't want to be, but the thought just won't go away."
Episode 5,sansa stark,and ARYA stare at each in silence for a moment.
Episode 5,sansa stark,I have work to do.
Episode 5,sansa stark,turns and walks away from ARYA.
Episode 5,arya stark,My lady.
Episode 5,arya stark,exits the room.
Episode 5,davos,and TYRION are standing on the beach of King's Landing. DAVOS is securing a small row boat. TYRION is looking up towards the city walls.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Last time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow.
Episode 5,davos,Last time I was here you killed my son with wildfire.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,turns to look at DAVOS. DAVOS walks next to TYRION and stakes the boat anchor into the sand.
Episode 5,davos,There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff. The guards hardly ever patrol it. Too many steps.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,begins walking towards the path. DAVOS follows him and quickly takes the lead. TYRION stops and looks back towards the unattended boat.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,You're not staying here?
Episode 5,davos,I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,What if someone takes the boat?
Episode 5,davos,Then we're fucked. Best hurry.
Episode 5,bronn,and JAIME are walking by the dragon skulls. Both men have sparring swords in their hand.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,We don't have time for this. We should be preparing the city for a siege. The Dothraki are coming.
Episode 5,bronn,All the more reason for you to train. Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12 year olds.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.
Episode 5,bronn,And here I am ready to train.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Why down here?
Episode 5,bronn,I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Today might be the day I kill you by accident.
Episode 5,bronn,"Oh, you won't be swinging it at me."
Episode 5,bronn,stops walking and holds his torch out. TYRION steps from around a pillar and looks at JAIME. JAIME looks angrily at BRONN.
Episode 5,bronn,I'll leave you to it.
Episode 5,bronn,turns and walks away leaving JAIME and TYRION alone.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,I needed to see you and I knew you'd never agree to meet.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,remains silent and stares at TYRION.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"You made me look like a complete fool. I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me. You abandoned the family home. Completely unsentimental. Father would have been proud."
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Don't talk about our father.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Listen to me --
Episode 5,jaime lannister,I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again I'd cut you in half.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,glances down at the sword in JAIME's hand.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,It would take you awhile with a sparring sword.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,shakes his head and says nothing.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"He was going to execute me. He knew I was innocent. He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am. The little monster sent to punish him. Do you think I wanted to be born this way? Did he think I chose --"
Episode 5,jaime lannister,What do you want?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Daenerys will win this war. You're a military man. You must know there is no way around it. Daenerys is not her father. She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,I -- I don't. Daenerys doesn't. Not right now anyway. She has a more important request.
Episode 5,davos,I wasn't sure I'd find you.
Episode 5,davos,I thought you might still be rowing.
Episode 5,davos,"I looked in shops, taverns, brothels. I should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel."
Episode 5,davos,I haven't been here in years. Why should they recognize me? Sometimes I hardly do. Nothing fucks you harder than time.
Episode 5,davos,"walks to the side of the shop and inspects a rack of swords. He pulls one, nods in approval and puts it back in its place. He turns back to GENDRY."
Episode 5,davos,Anybody give you any trouble?
Episode 5,davos,Don't be so sure. Safety is never a permanent state of affairs. Bad things are coming.
Episode 5,davos,I think you need to understand --
Episode 5,davos,You should know what you're heading into.
Episode 5,davos,You might want to bring one of those swords.
Episode 5,davos,and GENDRY are walking towards the boat DAVOS left on the beach.
Episode 5,davos,Keep your father's name to yourself. The situation is complicated enough already.
Episode 5,davos,turns and notices the two guards approaching the boat. He turns and loudly addresses GENDRY.
Episode 5,davos,"I told you, Clovis, if we don't get out of here soon someone is going to --"
Episode 5,davos,"No weapons, friends. I promise. What can I do for you?"
Episode 5,davos,It is.
Episode 5,davos,Still five gold dragons?
Episode 5,davos,15?
Episode 5,davos,angrily reaches into his pouch and pays the men.
Episode 5,davos,I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.
Episode 5,davos,turns and begins walking back to his boat.
Episode 5,davos,pauses and turns back to the guards.
Episode 5,davos,Not more gold.
Episode 5,davos,Come and have a look.
Episode 5,davos,Fermented crab.
Episode 5,davos,"Fermented crab. One bucket of this triples the brothel's earnings for the week. A man thinks he's done, he's ready to go back to his loving family, but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth. Five minutes later, he's back in the race. Here, have a taste."
Episode 5,davos,scoops up a bit of fermented crab and offers it to the guards. Both men reach out and take a pinch. The guards sniff the crab and put it in their mouth. They both recoil from the taste and look at each other.
Episode 5,davos,I'd hurry to your favorite establishment or you'll put a whole in that chainmail.
Episode 5,davos,quickly walks to cut the guards off.
Episode 5,davos,I really wouldn't try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Fish hook. Some men you just can't teach.
Episode 5,davos,is still standing behind the guards. He retrieves his gold pouch again and holds it up shaking it.
Episode 5,davos,Perhaps there's some arrangement?
Episode 5,davos,is looking at TYRION and motions towards GENDRY.
Episode 5,davos,This is Gendry.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,He'll do.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,opens the door and step into the queen's room. CERSEI is seated near a window speaking to QYBURN.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,That won't be necessary.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Why was QYBURN here?
Episode 5,cersei lannister,He's Hand of the Queen. Why are you here?
Episode 5,jaime lannister,I met with Tyrion.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,pauses for a moment making JAIME uncomfortable.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,What did our brother have to say?
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Daenerys wants to meet.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,To discuss a surrender?
Episode 5,jaime lannister,To discuss an armistice.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,She just won a great victory. Why would she want a truce now?
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Because an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms. Tyrion claims he'll have proof.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,smirks and looks away from JAIME.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Are you going to punish him?
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Tyrion?
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Bronn.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,looks confused.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,He betrayed you. He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent. Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing?
Episode 5,jaime lannister,You let it happen. Why?
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"I've come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest. She has the numbers. If we want to beat her we have to be clever. We have to fight her like father would have. Dead men, dragons and Dragon Queens, whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house. For this."
Episode 5,cersei lannister,lifts her hands from the chair and places them both on her stomach indicating she's pregnant. JAIME looks shocked.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Who will you say is the father?
Episode 5,cersei lannister,You.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,People won't like that.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,stands from her chair and walks in front of JAIME.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Do you remember what father used to say about people?
Episode 5,jaime lannister,The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,reaches forward and takes CERSEI and kisses her. While they embrace CERSEI speaks to JAIME.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Never betray me again.
Episode 5,davos,We're leaving today. The king's got a lot on his mind.
Episode 5,davos,He doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king.
Episode 5,davos,"You're just Clovis, a smith who's come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges."
Episode 5,davos,and GENDRY enter the mouth of the cave. JON is walking along the corridor.
Episode 5,davos,"Begging your pardon, Your Grace."
Episode 5,jon snow,stops and turns around to face DAVOS.
Episode 5,jon snow,You survived King's Landing.
Episode 5,davos,Yet again.
Episode 5,jon snow,"Your Grace, this is --"
Episode 5,jon snow,looks to DAVOS.
Episode 5,davos,He was meant to keep that to himself.
Episode 5,jon snow,I saw your father once at Winterfell.
Episode 5,jon snow,You're a lot leaner.
Episode 5,jon snow,stops smiling and pauses a moment. Then he chuckles.
Episode 5,jon snow,I grew up on stories about them.
Episode 5,davos,Don't be a fool. You're not a soldier.
Episode 5,jon snow,Do you know how to use one?
Episode 5,jon snow,"Well, that's a problem."
Episode 5,davos,He can handle himself.
Episode 5,jon snow,nods.
Episode 5,jon snow,We could use the help.
Episode 5,davos,"As my father used to say, it's better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life."
Episode 5,davos,Yeah. Nobody mind me. All I've ever done is live to a ripe old age.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"You may not believe it, but I've missed you Mormont. Nobody glowers quite like you. Not even Grey Worm."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,retrieves a gold coin from his pocket and turns it in his hands.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us. Remember?
Episode 5,jorah mormont,It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,smiles and hands the coin to JORAH.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Take it with you. You'll bring it back. Our queen needs you.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,nods to TYRION. DAENERYS appears and walks up to JORAH.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,We should be better at saying farewell by now.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,"Your Grace, I --"
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"reaches forward and takes JORAH by his hands. JON SNOW, DAVOS and GENDRY exit the cave and walk towards the boats. JORAH bends and kisses DAENERY's hand. He turns and continues readying the boat. JON stands in front of DAENERYS."
Episode 5,jon snow,If I don't return at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,smiles.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,But I've grown used to him.
Episode 5,jon snow,"I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,nods to JON. JON turns and walks to the head of the boat. The men take hold of it.
Episode 5,jon snow,Heave!
Episode 5,sam,is seated at a table surround by papers and candles. He is writing notes into a book. Gilly is seated across from him reading aloud from a tome. SAM JR. is playing on the bed.
Episode 5,sam,No.
Episode 5,sam,looks up from his work annoyed. He remains silent and continues working.
Episode 5,sam,"is walking through a dark library. He heads to the restricted section and unlocks the barred gate. He begins removing books and scrolls from shelfs and stuff them in his satchel. After retrieving what he needs, SAM quickly walks to the exit of the library. He pauses before he leaves and turns around. He glances back at the library. It is many stories tall lined with countless shelves of books. SAMWELL looks at the library one last time, turns and walks out of the door."
Episode 5,arya stark,is in the kennels observing PETER BAELISH and a Winterfell servant having a conversation. The servent is whispering in BAELISH's ear. ARYA can't hear the conversation. ARYA sees BAELISH hand the servant a raven scroll. The servant turns to leave. BAELISH senses someone is watching him and he looks to where ARYA stood but she has already vanished. BAELISH turns and leaves the kennels.
Episode 5,arya stark,is on the upper level looking down at BAELISH. He is having a conversation with ROBETT GLOVER and YOHN ROYCE. She can't hear what's being said. BAELISH finishes his conversation and walks away from the men. ARYA disappears behind the corner and continues following BAELISH.
Episode 5,arya stark,"is walking down the hallway. She pauses, peers around a corner and looks towards the door of BAELISH's quarters. BAELISH appears and unlocks his door. Before he walks in MAESTER WOLKAN approaches him. She continues watching the men."
Episode 5,petyr baelish,reads the note then looks at WOLKAN.
Episode 5,petyr baelish,Are you sure this is the only copy at Winterfell?
Episode 5,petyr baelish,Lady Stark thanks you for your service.
Episode 5,jon snow,and the raiding party land on the Beach of Eastwatch. JON looks up at the castle. The men collect their equipment and make for the castle.
Episode 5,davos,I've been failing at that job of late.
Episode 5,jon snow,Two.
Episode 5,jon snow,Both.
Episode 5,jon snow,looks around the table.
Episode 5,jon snow,Not enough.
Episode 5,jon snow,smiles and shakes his head. TORMUND is disappointed.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,We were hoping some of your men could help.
Episode 5,davos,I'll be staying behind. I'm a liability out there as you well know.
Episode 5,jon snow,You're The Hound. I saw you once at Winterfell.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,Thoros?
Episode 5,jorah mormont,I hardly recognized you.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,He was my father.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,"You returned the favor, as I recall."
Episode 5,davos,Our reasons aren't your reasons.
Episode 5,jorah mormont,Don't you want to know what we're doing?
Episode 5,jon snow,He's right. We're all on the same side.
Episode 5,jon snow,We're all breathing.
Episode 6,jon snow,Are you all right?
Episode 6,jon snow,Ever been north before?
Episode 6,jon snow,You've never been down south.
Episode 6,jon snow,That's the north.
Episode 6,jon snow,There's not another woman within 100 miles of here.
Episode 6,jon snow,glances at GENDRY. GENDRY backs away from JON and TORMUND.
Episode 6,jon snow,Davos says he is a strong fighter.
Episode 6,jon snow,She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.
Episode 6,jon snow,The first time I went north of the wall was with your father.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,He was a good man. He deserved a better son. Were you with him at the end?
Episode 6,jon snow,I was a prisoner of the Wildlings. But we avenged him. I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,"I can't think of a worse way for him to go. The Night's Watch was his life. He would have died to protect every one of those men, and they butchered him."
Episode 6,jon snow,I hate that he died that way. My father was the most honorable man I ever met. He was good all the way through. And he died on the executioner's block.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,Your father wanted to execute me.
Episode 6,jon snow,I heard.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,He was in the right of course. It didn't make me hate him any less.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,and JON glance at each other.
Episode 6,jon snow,I'm glad he didn't capture you.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,Me too.
Episode 6,jon snow,stops walking and loosens the belt holding his sword.
Episode 6,jon snow,"Your father gave me this sword. He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw."
Episode 6,jon snow,hands the sword to JORAH. JORAH slowly takes the sword and looks it over in his hands.
Episode 6,jon snow,Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,stops examining the sword and looks up to JON.
Episode 6,jon snow,But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries. It's not right for me to have it.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,"pauses, then nods at JON."
Episode 6,jorah mormont,He gave it to you.
Episode 6,jon snow,I'm not his son.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,"pulls the sword halfway out of the sheath and inspects the blade, turning it in his hands."
Episode 6,jorah mormont,I brought shame to my house. I broke my father's heart.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,resheaths the blade and hands it back to JON.
Episode 6,jorah mormont,I forfeited the right to claim this sword. It's yours. May it serve you well and your children after you.
Episode 6,arya stark,Father used to watch us from up here. He wouldn't say much. You probably don't remember. You were inside knitting all the time.
Episode 6,sansa stark,I remember.
Episode 6,arya stark,"One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick. I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground. Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw. There was one arrow in the target. There was no one around, just like now. No one to stop me. So I started shooting. And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again. I wasn't very good. Finally I hit the bullseye. It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th. I don't remember. But I hit the bullseye and I heard this."
Episode 6,arya stark,starts a slow clap.
Episode 6,arya stark,I looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me. I knew what I was doing was against the rules. But he was smiling so I knew it wasn't wrong. The rules were wrong. I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it. Now he's dead. Killed by the Lannisters with your help.
Episode 6,sansa stark,turns to look at ARYA.
Episode 6,sansa stark,What?
Episode 6,arya stark,retrieves a raven scroll from her pocket and unrolls it.
Episode 6,arya stark,"That's your pretty handwriting. Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles because I couldn't write as well as you. ""Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart. Our good King Robert is dead. Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt --"
Episode 6,sansa stark,You don't have to read it. I remember.
Episode 6,arya stark,"Father has been charged with treason. He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne. The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort. I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark. Your faithful sister, Sansa."
Episode 6,sansa stark,They forced me to do it.
Episode 6,arya stark,Did they. With a knife at your throat? Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?
Episode 6,sansa stark,You don't know what it was like. I was a child.
Episode 6,arya stark,So was I. I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.
Episode 6,sansa stark,They told me it was the only way to save father.
Episode 6,arya stark,And you were stupid enough to believe them. I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block. I remember the pretty dress you were wearing. I remember the fancy way you did your hair.
Episode 6,sansa stark,You were there?
Episode 6,arya stark,I was there standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.
Episode 6,sansa stark,And what did you do? Did you come running to the rescue? Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father?
Episode 6,arya stark,I wanted to.
Episode 6,sansa stark,But you didn't. Just like me.
Episode 6,arya stark,I didn't betray him. I didn't betray Robb. I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.
Episode 6,sansa stark,"You should be on your knees thanking me. We're standing in Winterfell again because of me. You didn't win it back. Jon didn't win it back. He lost the Battle of the Bastards. The Knight's of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where, traveling the world?"
Episode 6,arya stark,I was training.
Episode 6,sansa stark,"Training. Well, while you were training I suffered things you can never imagine."
Episode 6,arya stark,"Oh, I don't know about that. I can imagine quite a lot."
Episode 6,sansa stark,You never would have survived what I survived.
Episode 6,arya stark,I guess we'll never know.
Episode 6,sansa stark,What are you doing to do with that letter.
Episode 6,arya stark,I don't know yet.
Episode 6,sansa stark,Who did you show it to? Where did you find it?
Episode 6,arya stark,"You're scared, aren't you? What are you scared of? You didn't commit any crimes. No one's going to hang you."
Episode 6,sansa stark,Arya --
Episode 6,arya stark,Are you scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry? No. That's not Jon. He'll understand. You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.
Episode 6,sansa stark,"Do you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting? This is exactly what she wants. This is what she's always wanted, to tear us apart --"
Episode 6,arya stark,"The northern lords will read it. They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding. What would little Lyanna Mormont say? She's younger than you were when you wrote this. Are you going to say, ""But I was just a child""?"
Episode 6,sansa stark,You're angry. Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.
Episode 6,arya stark,Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things. I'll go with anger.
Episode 6,arya stark,turns and walks away.
Episode 6,jon snow,Who's that?
Episode 6,jon snow,You knew him?
Episode 6,jon snow,I serve the north.
Episode 6,jon snow,The lord of light never spoke to me. I don't know anything about him. I don't know what he wants from me.
Episode 6,jon snow,Why?
Episode 6,jon snow,"That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know. So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants."
Episode 6,jon snow,So what are you fighting for?
Episode 6,jon snow,But we all die.
Episode 6,jon snow,I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
Episode 6,jon snow,Aye. Maybe that's enough.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,is sitting in a chair staring into the fire. DAENERYS stands across the room next to the painted table.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,Do you know what I like about you?
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,turns to look at DAENERYS.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,I honestly don't.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,You're not a hero.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Oh. I've been heroic on occasion.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,walks over to the fire and sits in the chair opposite from TYRION.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,I once charged through the mud gate of King's Landing.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,"I don't want you to be a hero. Heroes do stupid things and they die. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"It's interesting these heroes you name. Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you."
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,Jon Snow's not in love with me.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Oh, my mistake. I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance."
Episode 7,bronn,Oil?
Episode 7,bronn,How many barrels?
Episode 7,bronn,Get 500 more.
Episode 7,bronn,"I still enjoy it when they call me ""my lord."""
Episode 7,jaime lannister,The thrill will fade.
Episode 7,bronn,If we live that long. Men without cocks. You wouldn't find me fighting in an army if I had no cock. What's left to fight for?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Gold?
Episode 7,bronn,I spent my life around soldiers. What do you think they spend that gold on?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Family.
Episode 7,bronn,"Not without a cock, you don't."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Maybe it really is all cocks in the end.
Episode 7,bronn,"Yet, your brother--"
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"Yes, he's always been a champion of the downtrodden."
Episode 7,bronn,I think we're about to be the downtrodden.
Episode 7,jon snow,How many people live here?
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"A million, give or take."
Episode 7,jon snow,That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way?
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,There's more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Why isn't she with them?
Episode 7,cersei lannister,And the rest of them?
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Including our brother.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"If anything goes wrong, kill the silver-haired bitch first, then our brother, then the bastard who calls himself king."
Episode 7,jorah mormont,"Dragons don't understand the difference between what is theirs and what isn't. Land, livestock, children... Letting them roam free around a city was a problem."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"I imagine it was a sad joke at the end. An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs. But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world."
Episode 7,davos,Maybe it still is.
Episode 7,bronn,"Welcome, my lords. Your friends arrived before you did."
Episode 7,bronn,I've been sent to escort you all to the meeting.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"Supporting the enemy, no less."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,Cersei will anyway.
Episode 7,bronn,Come on! You can suck his magic cock later.
Episode 7,brienne,I thought you were dead.
Episode 7,brienne,I was only trying to protect her.
Episode 7,brienne,She's alive. Arya.
Episode 7,brienne,Winterfell.
Episode 7,brienne,The only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,Here we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a reunion.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick. Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater."
Episode 7,bronn,I'm sure your new queen--
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,You've been thinking about our new queen.
Episode 7,varys,"And that would be double what now, exactly?"
Episode 7,bronn,Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right. Looking after myself.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk."
Episode 7,bronn,"I put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,It's good to see you again.
Episode 7,bronn,"Yeah, you, too."
Episode 7,bronn,"Come on, Pod. Let's you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk, eh?"
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,You might.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Where is she?
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,She'll be here soon.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Didn't travel with you?
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,No.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,We've been here for some time.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,My apologies.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,We are all facing a unique
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes? His wasn't even good. He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Perhaps you ought to sit down.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Sit down or leave.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?"
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,We all know that will never happen.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Then why are we here?
Episode 7,jon snow,This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.
Episode 7,jon snow,This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"I don't think it's serious at all. I think it's another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking me for a truce."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Yes. That's all.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,That's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,The word of a would-be usurper.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you.
Episode 7,jon snow,We can destroy them by burning them.
Episode 7,jon snow,"And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world."
Episode 7,jon snow,There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,I didn't believe it until I saw them. I saw them all.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,How many?
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"A hundred thousand, at least."
Episode 7,jon snow,No.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,What are you talking about?
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"He's right to be afraid. And a coward to run. If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule. Everything we suffered will have been for nothing. Everything we lost will have been for nothing. The crown accepts your truce. Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"In return, the King"
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,Just the King
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"I would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark's son. I know Ned Stark's son."
Episode 7,jon snow,I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Then there is nothing left to discuss. The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them. We will deal with whatever is left of you.
Episode 7,brienne,Ser Jaime.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,It's been good to see you. I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield.
Episode 7,brienne,We both saw what just happened. We both saw that thing.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"Yes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them. But I'm loyal to the queen and you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother."
Episode 7,brienne,"Oh, fuck loyalty!"
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Fuck loyalty?
Episode 7,brienne,This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths. Talk to the queen.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,And tell her what?
Episode 7,davos,I wish you hadn't done that.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"I'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing."
Episode 7,jon snow,I know!
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen
Episode 7,jon snow,I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,That is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.
Episode 7,davos,Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,I didn't come all this way to have my Hand
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,I don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.
Episode 7,jon snow,I did this. I should go.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,She'll definitely murder you. I go see my sister.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,You spoke with her?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"At her until she kicked me out. She thinks I was an idiot to trust you. A lot of people seem to think that, actually."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"I'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who's an idiot?"
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"I suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"So you bring her here with her pet Northerner, whom you've convinced to bow down before her."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,I didn't know about that.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"And now you've got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you've worked towards your entire life."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"Cersei, I didn't know."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,the destruction of this family.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,You killed our father
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"Oh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen. No one wouldo ve touched them if Father--"
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,I have never been more sorry about anything.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"I will not hear it, not from you."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,I will not hear it!
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So put an end to me."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"If it weren't for me, you'd have a motherIf it weren't for me, you'd have a father."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,I will not
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,I don't care. I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,It doesn't matter. Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter. I don't care why you did what you did. I only care what it cost us. It cost us our future.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"If there's no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?"
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,What did you hope for? To make Jon Snow submit to your queen.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,"Mm, not like this."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,Yes.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Why?
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,Because I think she will make the world a better place.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,You said she'd destroy King's Landing.
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,That's the difference between you. I don't care about checking my worst impulses. I don't care about making the world a better place. Hang the world.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea. Get on a boat, take those who matter."
Episode 7,tyrion lannister,You're pregnant.
Episode 7,jon snow,No one is less happy about this than I am.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"I know. I respect what you did. Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"This place was the beginning of the end for my family. A dragon is not a slave. They were terrifying. Extraordinary. They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here. They wasted away. They grew small. And we grew small as well. We weren't extraordinary without them. We were just like everyone else."
Episode 7,jon snow,You're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here.
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,I can't have children.
Episode 7,jon snow,Who told you that?
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,The witch who murdered my husband.
Episode 7,jon snow,Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"You were right from the beginning. If I had trusted you, everything would be different."
Episode 7,jon snow,"So, what now?"
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall. And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march north.
Episode 7,jon snow,It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"My armies will not stand down. I will not pull them back to the capital. I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War. The darkness is coming for us all. We'll face it together. And when the Great War is over, perhaps you'll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you. I expect not. Call our banners. All of them."
Episode 7,petyr baelish,It's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms. Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier.
Episode 7,sansa stark,"No, this is the way he is, the way he's always been. He never asked for my opinion. Why would he start now?"
Episode 7,petyr baelish,I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you.
Episode 7,sansa stark,"This is his writing, his signature. He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen. He's bent the knee."
Episode 7,petyr baelish,I've heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful.
Episode 7,sansa stark,What does that have to do with anything?
Episode 7,petyr baelish,Jon is young and unmarried. Daenerys is young and unmarried.
Episode 7,sansa stark,You think he wants to marry her?
Episode 7,petyr baelish,"An alliance makes sense. Together, they'd be difficult to defeat. He was named King."
Episode 7,sansa stark,"Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along. She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me, and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family."
Episode 7,petyr baelish,"You are family, too. Would Arya really murder her own sister?"
Episode 7,sansa stark,Do you know what she is now? Do you know what the Faceless Men are?
Episode 7,petyr baelish,"Only by reputation. They worship the God of Death, I believe. I never trust godly men."
Episode 7,sansa stark,They're killers. And Arya was one of them. What do you think she's after?
Episode 7,petyr baelish,She's your sister
Episode 7,sansa stark,She could want me dead because she thinks I wronged my family.
Episode 7,petyr baelish,Why did she come to Winterfell?
Episode 7,sansa stark,To kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family.
Episode 7,petyr baelish,Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write?
Episode 7,sansa stark,To provide proof of my betrayals. To provide justification after she murders me.
Episode 7,petyr baelish,"And after she murders you, what does she become?"
Episode 7,sansa stark,Lady
Episode 7,jon snow,"If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,"And the Unsullied? We can sail with them to White Harbor, meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad, then ride together to Winterfell."
Episode 7,jorah mormont,"Perhaps you should fly to Winterfell, Your Grace. You have many enemies in the North. Thousands fell fighting your fatherAll it takes is one angry man with a crossbow. He'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero. The man who killed the conqueror."
Episode 7,jon snow,"It's your decision, Your Grace. But if we're going to be allies in this war, it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies. If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message."
Episode 7,daenerys targaryen,I've not come to conquer the North. I'm coming to save the North. We sail together.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,Jon.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,Can I speak with you?
Episode 7,jon snow,All right.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,"What you did in King's Landing, what you said... You couldo ve lied to Cersei about bending the knee to Daenerys. You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth."
Episode 7,jon snow,We went down there to make peace. And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,"You've always known what was right. Even when we were all young and stupid, you always knew. Every step you take it's always the right step."
Episode 7,jon snow,"It's not. It may seem that way from the outside, but I promise you, it's not true. I've done plenty of things that I regret."
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,"Not compared to me, you haven't."
Episode 7,jon snow,No. Not compared to you.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,I always wanted to do the right thing. Be the right kind of person. But I never knew what that meant. It always seemed like there's like there was an impossible choice I had to make. Stark or Greyjoy.
Episode 7,jon snow,Our father was more of a father.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,He was.
Episode 7,jon snow,And you betrayed him. Betrayed his memory.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,I did.
Episode 7,jon snow,But you never lost him. He's a part of you. Just like he's a part of me.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,But the things I've done.
Episode 7,jon snow,"It's not my place to forgive you for all of it. But what I can forgive, I do. You don't need to choose. You're a Greyjoy and you're a Stark."
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,"When I was Ramsay's prisoner, Yara tried to save me. She's the only one who tried to save me. She needs me now."
Episode 7,jon snow,"So, why are you still talking to me?"
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,All of us chose to follow Yara. We left the Iron Islands for Yara. She would never leave one of us behind. We're not leaving her behind.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,She's not dead.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,She's our queen
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,I did. I ran from my uncle.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,We're done with all that.
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,"Yara did. She made a pledge. We're going to find her, and we're going to set her free."
Episode 7,theon greyjoy,Not for me. For Yara!
Episode 7,sansa stark,Have my sister
Episode 7,arya stark,Are you sure you want to do this?
Episode 7,sansa stark,It's not what I want. It's what honor demands.
Episode 7,arya stark,And what does honor demand?
Episode 7,sansa stark,That I defend my family from those who would harm us. That I defend the North from those who would betray us.
Episode 7,arya stark,"All right, then. Get on with it."
Episode 7,sansa stark,You stand accused of murder. You stand accused of treason. How do you answer these charges Lord Baelish?
Episode 7,arya stark,My sister asked you a question.
Episode 7,petyr baelish,"Lady Sansa, forgive me I'm a bit confused."
Episode 7,sansa stark,"Which charges confuse you? Let's start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn. You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall. Do you deny it?"
Episode 7,petyr baelish,I did it to protect you.
Episode 7,sansa stark,"You did it to take power in the Vale. Earlier, you conspired to murder Jon."
Episode 7,petyr baelish,Whatever your aunt
Episode 7,sansa stark,You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon.
Episode 7,petyr baelish,I know of no such letter.
Episode 7,sansa stark,You conspired with Cersei Lannister and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father.
Episode 7,petyr baelish,I deny it! None of you were there to see what happened. None of you knows the truth.
Episode 7,arya stark,You told our mother
Episode 7,petyr baelish,"Lady Sansa, I have known you since you were a girl. I've protected you."
Episode 7,sansa stark,Protected me? By selling me to the Boltons?
Episode 7,petyr baelish,"If we could speak alone, I can explain everything."
Episode 7,sansa stark,"Sometimes when I'm trying to understand a person's motives, I play a little game. I assume the worst. What's the worst reason you have for turning me against my sisterThat's what you do, isn't it? That's what you've always done turn family against family, turn sister against sister. That's what you did to our mother."
Episode 7,petyr baelish,"Sansa, please."
Episode 7,sansa stark,"I'm a slow learner, it's true. But I learn."
Episode 7,petyr baelish,Give me a chance to defend myself. I deserve that.
Episode 7,petyr baelish,I am Lord Protector of the Vale and I command you to escort me safely back to the Eyrie.
Episode 7,petyr baelish,"Sansa, I beg you! I loved your mother since the time I was a boy."
Episode 7,sansa stark,"And yet, you betrayed her."
Episode 7,petyr baelish,I loved you. More than anyone.
Episode 7,sansa stark,"And yet, you betrayed me."
Episode 7,sansa stark,"When you brought me back to Winterfell, you told me there's no justice in the world, not unless we make it. Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish. I will never forget them."
Episode 7,petyr baelish,Sansa! I--
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Our men in King's Landing will march north in three days' time.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"We don't have a fortnight. If the North falls, we fall. Three days. The remaining forces in the Westerlands will take the river road east. We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town and march together to Winterfell."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Ser Jaime.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Your Grace.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"My lords, I need a moment with my brother."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,What are you doing?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Preparing the expedition north.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"Expedition north? I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister. The Starks and Targaryens have united against us, and you want to fight alongside them? Are you a traitor or an idiot?"
Episode 7,jaime lannister,You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,I'll say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house. You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,You saw it with your own eyes. You saw a dead man trying to kill us.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"I saw it burn. If dragons can't stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them, how will our armies make a difference?"
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"This isn't about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead!"
Episode 7,cersei lannister,And I intend to stay amongst the living. Let the Stark boy and his new queen--
Episode 7,jaime lannister,I made a promise.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Our child will rule Westeros.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Our child will never be born if the dead come south.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"The monsters are real. The white walkers, the dragons, the Dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young, they're all real. So be it. Let the monsters kill each other. And while they battle in the North, we take back the lands that belong to us."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,And then what?
Episode 7,cersei lannister,And then we rule.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins. You understand that, don't you? If the dead win, they march south and kill us all. If the living win, and we've betrayed them, they march south and kill us all!"
Episode 7,cersei lannister,The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all. Most of them will die in the North.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,I faced them in the field. We can't beat them. We can't beat their dragons.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,How many dragons did you see at the pit?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Two.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,What happened to the third?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"For all we know, it's guarding her fleet!"
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied. She came here to show us all her power. No, something happened.The dragons are vulnerable."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,We can't beat the Dothraki. We don't have the numbers. We don't have the support of the other houses!
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"No, we have something better. We have the Iron Bank. You shouldo ve listened more when Father--"
Episode 7,jaime lannister,The Golden Company is not here. They're in Essos. How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands? Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen?
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me, the commander."
Episode 7,cersei lannister,"And you conspired with Tyrion, the man who murdered our father without telling me, your queen."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,I didn't conspire with him.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,You met with him in secret without my consent. You planned to promote my enemies' interests. That is the definition of conspiracy.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,I pledged to ride north. I intend to honor that pledge.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,And that will be treason.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Treason?
Episode 7,cersei lannister,Disobeying your queen
Episode 7,jaime lannister,Doesn't matter what I'd call it.
Episode 7,cersei lannister,I told you no one walks away from me.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"Are you going to order him to kill me? I'm the only one you have left. Our children are gone, our father"
Episode 7,cersei lannister,There's one more yet to come.
Episode 7,jaime lannister,"Give the order, then."
Episode 7,jaime lannister,I don't believe you.
Episode 7,sam,I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.
Episode 7,sam,"Oh, well, thank you, but, um, I'm not sure that I am. What happened to you beyond the Wall?"
Episode 7,sam,Oh! I don't know what that means.
Episode 7,sam,"Um, Jon's the one to lead the fight against the dead. I know he is. But he can't do it alone, so I've come here to help him."
Episode 7,sam,Oh.
Episode 7,sam,The truth about what?
Episode 7,sam,It's not.
Episode 7,sam,"At the Citadel, I transcribed a High Septon's diary. He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia. He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony."
Episode 7,sam,It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary. I don't know why he'd lie. Is this something you can see?
Episode 7,arya stark,Are you all right?
Episode 7,sansa stark,"It's just strange. In his own horrible way, I believe he loved me."
Episode 7,arya stark,You did the right thing.
Episode 7,sansa stark,You did it.
Episode 7,arya stark,I'm just the executioner. You passed the sentence. You're the Lady.
Episode 7,sansa stark,Does that bother you?
Episode 7,arya stark,I was never going to be as good a lady as you. So I had to be something else. I never could have survived what you survived.
Episode 7,sansa stark,You would have. You're the strongest person I know.
Episode 7,arya stark,I believe that's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.
Episode 7,sansa stark,"Well, don't get used to it. You're still very strange and annoying."
Episode 7,arya stark,"In winter, we must protect ourselves. Look after one another."
Episode 7,sansa stark,Father
Episode 7,arya stark,I miss him.
Episode 7,sansa stark,"Me, too."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won't freeze off.
Episode 1,varys,"You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?"
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Because I have balls, and you don't."
Episode 1,jon snow,I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.
Episode 1,jon snow,Look at you.
Episode 1,jon snow,You're a man.
Episode 1,jon snow,Where's Arya?
Episode 1,sansa stark,Lurking somewhere.
Episode 1,jon snow,"Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell."
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,"Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark. The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you."
Episode 1,sansa stark,"Winterfell is yours, Your Grace."
Episode 1,sansa stark,"As soon as we heard about the Wall, I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell. Lord Umber when can we expect your people to arrive?"
Episode 1,sansa stark,You'll have as many as we can spare. Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.
Episode 1,jon snow,We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here.
Episode 1,jon snow,It's not important.
Episode 1,jon snow,"You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. I'll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die."
Episode 1,sansa stark,"May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? While I ensured our stores would last through winter, I didn't account for Dothraki, Unsullied and two full-grown dragons. What do dragons eat, anyway?"
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Whatever they want.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,My lord. My lady.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,The Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it.
Episode 1,sansa stark,"So does Hand of the Queen. Depending on the queen, I suppose."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair.
Episode 1,sansa stark,It had its moments.
Episode 1,sansa stark,Apologies for leaving like that.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder."
Episode 1,sansa stark,We both survived.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you'll be safe-"
Episode 1,sansa stark,Cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,She did.
Episode 1,sansa stark,And you believed her?
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.
Episode 1,sansa stark,I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.
Episode 1,arya stark,You used to be taller.
Episode 1,jon snow,How did you sneak up on me?
Episode 1,arya stark,How did you survive a knife through the heart?
Episode 1,jon snow,I didn't.
Episode 1,jon snow,You still have it.
Episode 1,arya stark,Needle.
Episode 1,jon snow,Have you ever used it?
Episode 1,arya stark,Once or twice.
Episode 1,arya stark,Valyrian steel.
Episode 1,jon snow,Jealous?
Episode 1,arya stark,Too heavy for me.
Episode 1,jon snow,Where were you before? I couldo ve used your help with Sansa.
Episode 1,arya stark,"She doesn't like your queen, does she?"
Episode 1,jon snow,Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.
Episode 1,arya stark,She's the smartest person I've ever met.
Episode 1,jon snow,Now you're defending her?
Episode 1,jon snow,You?
Episode 1,arya stark,I'm defending our family. So is she.
Episode 1,jon snow,Yeah. I'm her family too.
Episode 1,arya stark,Don't forget that.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Good.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"Twenty-thousand men, is it?"
Episode 1,cersei lannister,Horses?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,And elephants?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,That's disappointing. I was told the Golden Company had elephants.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"In any event, you are most welcome here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,You are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,After the war. That was our agreement.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"You want a whore, buy one. You want a queen, earn her."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,You're insolent. I've executed men for less.
Episode 1,bronn,I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.
Episode 1,bronn,Nearly killed it.
Episode 1,bronn,"All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?"
Episode 1,bronn,You're kidding me.
Episode 1,bronn,"Sorry, ladies. Another time perhaps."
Episode 1,bronn,Which girl?
Episode 1,bronn,"She once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them."
Episode 1,bronn,"So, she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers. If it's the Dragon Queen she's after-"
Episode 1,bronn,"Yeah, well, good luck with that."
Episode 1,bronn,That fucking family.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,I wanted those elephants.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,You're insulting my late husband?
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"Robert had a different whore every night, but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?"
Episode 1,cersei lannister,"You're not boring, I'll give you that."
Episode 1,cersei lannister,You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met. I like that.
Episode 1,cersei lannister,But now I want to be alone.
Episode 1,theon greyjoy,Daenerys went north.
Episode 1,theon greyjoy,You're my queen. I go where you command.
Episode 1,theon greyjoy,What is dead may never die.
Episode 1,varys,The Karstarks.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,"One of the better sigils. Beats an onion, anyway."
Episode 1,davos,Can't argue with that.
Episode 1,davos,"Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield. Jon Snow brought peace to the houses."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,And our queen is grateful.
Episode 1,davos,"Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point. The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her. They don't know her. The Free Folk don't know her. I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you, they're stubborn as goats. You want their loyalty, you have to earn it."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,I sense that you're leading to a proposal.
Episode 1,davos,"A proposal is what I'm proposing. On the off chance that we survive the Night King, what if the Seven Kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history, were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?"
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,They do make a handsome couple.
Episode 1,varys,You overestimate our influence. Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,I'm not that old.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Not as old as him.
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,Our queen respects the wisdom of age.
Episode 1,varys,"Of course she does. Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth."
Episode 1,tyrion lannister,What is that?
Episode 1,varys,Nothing lasts.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Your sister doesn't like me.
Episode 1,jon snow,"She doesn't know you. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up."
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,She doesn't need to be my friend but I am her queen. If she can't respect me-
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,How many today?
Episode 1,jon snow,What's the matter?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,The dragons are barely eating.
Episode 1,jon snow,What's wrong with them?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,They don't like the North.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Go on.
Episode 1,jon snow,I don't know how to ride a dragon.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon.
Episode 1,jon snow,What if he doesn't want me to?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,"Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow."
Episode 1,jon snow,What do I hold onto?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Whatever you can.
Episode 1,jon snow,You've completely ruined horses for me.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,We could stay a thousand years-
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,No one would find us.
Episode 1,jon snow,We'd be pretty old.
Episode 1,jon snow,It's cold up here for a southern girl.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,So keep your queen warm.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Don't be afraid.
Episode 1,arya stark,Leave him be.
Episode 1,arya stark,First I robbed you.
Episode 1,arya stark,That was a nice ax you made for him. You've gotten better.
Episode 1,arya stark,Thanks. So do you.
Episode 1,arya stark,"Stay close to that forge, then."
Episode 1,arya stark,Don't call me that.
Episode 1,arya stark,Here's my wish.
Episode 1,arya stark,Can you make it?
Episode 1,arya stark,Can you make it or not?
Episode 1,arya stark,You don't know any other rich girls.
Episode 1,sansa stark,Come in.
Episode 1,sansa stark,"Lord Glover wishes us good fortune, but he's staying in Deepwood Motte with his men."
Episode 1,jon snow,"House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years."" Isn't that what he said?"
Episode 1,sansa stark,"I will stand behind Jon Snow,"" he said."
Episode 1,sansa stark,The King in the North.
Episode 1,jon snow,I told you we needed allies.
Episode 1,sansa stark,You didn't tell me you were going to abandon your crown.
Episode 1,jon snow,"I never wanted a crown. All I wanted was to protect the North. I brought two armies home with me, two dragons."
Episode 1,sansa stark,And a Targaryen queen.
Episode 1,jon snow,"Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance."
Episode 1,jon snow,Do you have any faith in me at all?
Episode 1,sansa stark,You know I do.
Episode 1,jon snow,She'll be a good queen. For all of us. She's not her father.
Episode 1,sansa stark,"No, she's much prettier."
Episode 1,sansa stark,Did you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,So you're the man?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,The one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could.
Episode 1,jorah mormont,"They could, they just wouldn't."
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,I'll have to make some changes in the Citadel when I take my throne. A great service merits a great reward.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,"Well, there must be something I could give you."
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,For what crime?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,From the Citadel?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Not Randyll Tarly?
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,I offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee. He refused.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Your brother stood with your father.
Episode 1,daenerys targaryen,Of course.
Episode 1,jon snow,Sam?
Episode 1,jon snow,Were you hiding from me?
Episode 1,jon snow,What are you doing in Winterfell? Or did you read every book in the Citadel already?
Episode 1,jon snow,What's wrong? Gilly? Is she all right?
Episode 1,jon snow,Little Sam?
Episode 1,jon snow,Know what?
Episode 1,jon snow,I'm so sorry. We need to end this war.
Episode 1,jon snow,"Well, I've executed men who disobeyed me."
Episode 1,jon snow,I wasn't a king.
Episode 1,jon snow,"I gave up my crown, Sam."
Episode 1,jon snow,I bent the knee. I'm not King in the North anymore.
Episode 1,jon snow,What are you talking about?
Episode 1,jon snow,My father was the most honorable man I ever met. You're saying he lied to me all my life.
Episode 1,jon snow,Daenerys is our queen.
Episode 1,jon snow,That's treason.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"When I was a child, my brother would tell me a bedtime story about the man who murdered our father."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat. Who sat down on the Iron Throne and watched as his blood poured onto the floor.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,He told me other stories as well. About all the things we would do to that man once we took back the Seven Kingdoms and had him in our grasp.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Your sister pledged to send her army north.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,She did.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"I don't see an army. I see one man, with one hand. It appears your sister lied to me."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,She lied to me as well. She never had any intention of sending her army north.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet and 20,000 fresh troops. The Golden Company from Essos, bought and paid for. Even if we defeat the dead, she'll have more than enough to destroy the survivors."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"We""?"
Episode 2,jaime lannister,I promised to fight for the living. I intend to keep that promise.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, I know my brother-"
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Like you knew your sister?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received. Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?"
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat."
Episode 2,sansa stark,"You're right. We can't trust him. He attacked my father in the streets. He tried to destroy my house and my family, the same as he did yours."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"Do you want me to apologize? I won't. We were at war. Everything I did, I did for my house and my family. I'd do it all again."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,So why have you abandoned your house and family now?
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Because this goes beyond loyalty.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,This is about survival.
Episode 2,brienne,"You don't know me well, Your Grace."
Episode 2,brienne,"But I know Ser Jaime. He is a man of honor. I was his captor once. But when we were both taken prisoner and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me, Ser Jaime defended me. And lost his hand because of it."
Episode 2,brienne,"Without him, my lady, you would not be alive. He armed me, armored me, and sent me to find you and bring you home because he'd sworn an oath to your mother."
Episode 2,sansa stark,You vouch for him?
Episode 2,brienne,I do.
Episode 2,sansa stark,You would fight beside him?
Episode 2,brienne,I would.
Episode 2,sansa stark,"I trust you with my life. If you trust him with yours, we should let him stay."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,What does the Warden of the North say about it?
Episode 2,jon snow,We need every man we can get.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Very well.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"Thank you, Your Grace."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know at all. Which makes you either a traitor or a fool."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I was a fool.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Not for the first time.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"Cersei still sits on the throne. If you can't help me take it back, I'll find another Hand who can."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over.
Episode 2,arya stark,You make my weapon yet?
Episode 2,arya stark,You should make mine first. And make sure it's stronger than this.
Episode 2,arya stark,Are you going to be down in the crypt?
Episode 2,arya stark,But you're a fighter.
Episode 2,arya stark,You've fought them?
Episode 2,arya stark,How many?
Episode 2,arya stark,What are they like?
Episode 2,arya stark,"Really bad""?"
Episode 2,arya stark,"Even a smith's apprentice can do better than ""really bad."" What do they look like? What do they smell like? How do they move? How hard are they to kill?"
Episode 2,arya stark,I know Death.
Episode 2,arya stark,He's got many faces.
Episode 2,arya stark,I look forward to seeing this one.
Episode 2,arya stark,My weapon?
Episode 2,jaime lannister,I'm sorry for what I did to you.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,I'm not that person anymore.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,You're not?
Episode 2,jaime lannister,You're not angry at me.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Why didn't you tell them?
Episode 2,jaime lannister,What about afterwards?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Well, here we are."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"Yes, here we are."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Together again.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,And the masses rejoice.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,How do they feel about their new queen?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,She's your new queen too.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They'll come around once they see Daenerys is different.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,And she is? Different?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,She is.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,You're sure about her?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I am.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,She didn't seem sure about you.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,It's hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Hmm.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Was she lying about the baby too?
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"No, that part is real."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies. I wouldn't be too hard on yourself. She's fooled me more than anybody.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,What?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"So we're going to die at Winterfell. Not the death I wouldo ve chosen. I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and-"
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Your cock.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,My cock.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,At least Cersei won't get to murder me. I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Maybe after I'm dead I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart.
Episode 2,brienne,Ser Jaime.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Lady Brienne.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,He's come a long way.
Episode 2,brienne,He's alright. Still has a lot to learn.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,I'm sure you'll teach him. I've been told you're commanding the left flank.
Episode 2,brienne,"I am. It's, uh-it's good ground."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,It is.
Episode 2,brienne,"The rise, it should give us some advantage."
Episode 2,brienne,"If we can keep a tight formation, we might be able to beat them back."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"Yes, I think you're right."
Episode 2,brienne,What are you doing?
Episode 2,brienne,I think you know.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,I truly don't.
Episode 2,brienne,We have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me. Not once.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,You want me to insult you?
Episode 2,brienne,No!
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Good.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"I came to Winterfell because-I'm not the fighter I used to be. But I'd be honored to serve under your command, if you'll have me."
Episode 2,brienne,I better get back.
Episode 2,jorah mormont,"Forgive me, khaleesi."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Have you done something to offend me?
Episode 2,jorah mormont,Many things.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Long ago and long forgiven.
Episode 2,jorah mormont,"But you did forgive, despite my failures. When I heard you'd named Tyrion your Hand, it broke my heart."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"When I named him Hand, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again."
Episode 2,jorah mormont,You made the right choice.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.
Episode 2,jorah mormont,I didn't. His mouth hardly stopped moving between Volantis and Meereen. It was all I could do not to throw him in the sea.
Episode 2,jorah mormont,But the mind behind all those words-
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,He's made mistakes. Serious mistakes.
Episode 2,jorah mormont,As have we all. He owns his and learns from them.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,You're advising me to forgive the man who stole your position?
Episode 2,jorah mormont,"I am. And one other suggestion, if you'll allow me."
Episode 2,sansa stark,Keep them open for as long as you can. There are still people coming in from the countryside.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before. About Ser Jaime.
Episode 2,sansa stark,"Brienne has been loyal to me, always. I trust her more than anyone."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.
Episode 2,sansa stark,Tyrion is a good man. He was never anything but decent towards me.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be. He never should have trusted Cersei."
Episode 2,sansa stark,You never should have either.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,I thought he knew his sister.
Episode 2,sansa stark,Families are complicated.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Ours certainly have been.
Episode 2,sansa stark,A sad thing to have in common.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"We have other things in common. We've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule. And we've both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another. Why is that? Your brother."
Episode 2,sansa stark,"He loves you, you know that."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,That bothers you.
Episode 2,sansa stark,Men do stupid things for women. They're easily manipulated.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"All my life, I've known one goal"
Episode 2,sansa stark,I should have thanked you the moment you arrived. That was a mistake.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"I'm here because I love your brother and I trust him, and I know he's true to his word. He's only the second man in my life I can say that about."
Episode 2,sansa stark,Who was the first?
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Someone taller.
Episode 2,sansa stark,"And what happens afterwards? We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei. What happens then?"
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,I take the Iron Throne.
Episode 2,sansa stark,"What about the North? It was taken from us, and we took it back. And we said we'd never bow to anyone else again. What about the North?"
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,What is it?
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,My queen.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Your sister?
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,"She only has a few ships, and she couldn't sail them here. So, she's sailing to the Iron Islands instead, to take them back in your name."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,But why aren't you with her?
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,"I want to fight for Winterfell, Lady Sansa, if you'll have me."
Episode 2,davos,"You are now. Look, I made it through most of my years without ever getting near a fight, but then I survived the Battle of the Bastards. Right outside these walls. If I can live through that, you can live through this. They'll outfit you with weapons at the forge. Right that way."
Episode 2,davos,Which way do you want to go?
Episode 2,davos,I'm sure a lot of people would.
Episode 2,jon snow,I thought we'd lost you.
Episode 2,jon snow,How did you find each other?
Episode 2,jon snow,The Umbers?
Episode 2,jon snow,How long do we have?
Episode 2,jon snow,They're coming.
Episode 2,jon snow,We have dragonglass and Valyrian steel.
Episode 2,jon snow,But there are too many of them.
Episode 2,jon snow,Far too many.
Episode 2,jon snow,Our enemy doesn't tire.
Episode 2,jon snow,Doesn't stop. Doesn't feel.
Episode 2,jon snow,We can't beat them in a straight fight.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"So, what can we do?"
Episode 2,jon snow,The Night King made them all. They follow his command. If he falls Getting to him may be our best chance.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"If that's true, he'll never expose himself."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,How will he find you?
Episode 2,jon snow,"We'll put you in the crypt, where it's safest."
Episode 2,sansa stark,You want us to use you as bait?
Episode 2,arya stark,We're not leaving you alone out there.
Episode 2,theon greyjoy,He won't be. I'll stay with him. With the Ironborn. I took this castle from you. Let me defend you now.
Episode 2,davos,We'll hold off the rest of them for as long as we can.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"When the time comes, Ser Davos and I will be on the walls, to give you the signal to light the trench."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own. You'll be in the crypt.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Your Grace, I have fought before, I can do it again. Alongside the men and women risking their lives."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"There are thousands of them and only one of you. You can't fight as well as they can, but you can think better than any of them. You're here because of your mind. If we survive, I'll need it."
Episode 2,davos,The dragons should give us an edge in the field.
Episode 2,jon snow,"If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran. We need to be near him. Not too near, or the Night King won't come. But close enough to pursue him when he does."
Episode 2,arya stark,Dragonfire will stop him?
Episode 2,jon snow,Let's get some rest.
Episode 2,jon snow,Your Grace.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Do you need help?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,You've had a strange journey.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I'd like to hear about it.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"If only we were trapped in a castle, in the middle of winter, with nowhere to go."
Episode 2,jon snow,No.
Episode 2,jon snow,Gilly? Little Sam?
Episode 2,jon snow,If you want to join them.
Episode 2,jon snow,To protect them.
Episode 2,jon snow,Now it's just us three.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I wish Father were here.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I would love to see the look on his face when he realizes his two sons are about to die defending Winterfell.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,That would be something to see.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"I remember the first time we were here, the first time I saw this hall."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Mm.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,You were a golden lion. I was a drunken whore-monger. It was all so simple.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,It wasn't so simple. I was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the world who was sleeping with his sister.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I was speaking in relative terms.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Do you miss it?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Of course I miss it.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"Well, my golden lion days are done, but whore-mongering is still an option for you."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,It's not. Things would be easier if it were.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,The perils of self-betterment.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Oh! My lady.
Episode 2,brienne,"Oh, we didn't mean to interrupt. We were just looking for somewhere warm to-"
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,To contemplate your imminent death. You've come to the right place. You want some of this piss? It's not bad. It's not good either.
Episode 2,brienne,I don't think that's wise.
Episode 2,brienne,The battle might start at any moment.
Episode 2,brienne,Half cup.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,And you?
Episode 2,brienne,"No, thank you. I should try and get some sleep."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,You really think any of us are going to sleep tonight? Join us.
Episode 2,brienne,All right. Just a bit.
Episode 2,davos,"Well, what do we have here?"
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Ser Davos, join us."
Episode 2,davos,"No, not for me, thanks. Came here for this."
Episode 2,davos,I figured I could wait to die freezing my balls off out there or wait to die nice and warm in here.
Episode 2,brienne,"Yes, well, I'm glad you're here."
Episode 2,brienne,Here fighting with us. Glad you survived Eastwatch.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Would you like a drink?
Episode 2,jaime lannister,I'm sure someone does.
Episode 2,davos,Maybe I will have that drink.
Episode 2,arya stark,Guess I've changed.
Episode 2,arya stark,What are you doing up here?
Episode 2,arya stark,"No, I mean, what are you doing up here? You joined the Brotherhood. You went beyond the Wall with Jon. You're here now. Why? When was the last time you fought for anyone but yourself?"
Episode 2,arya stark,For a little while.
Episode 2,arya stark,I'm not spending my final hours with you two miserable old shits.
Episode 2,arya stark,That for me?
Episode 2,arya stark,This'll work.
Episode 2,arya stark,What did the Red Woman want with you?
Episode 2,arya stark,Why your blood?
Episode 2,arya stark,Was that your first time?
Episode 2,arya stark,Your first time with a woman.
Episode 2,arya stark,Were you with other girls before that in King's Landing?
Episode 2,arya stark,Or after?
Episode 2,arya stark,You don't remember?
Episode 2,arya stark,One? Two? Twenty?
Episode 2,arya stark,"Yes, you did."
Episode 2,arya stark,We're probably going to die soon. I want to know what it's like before that happens.
Episode 2,arya stark,I'm not the Red Woman. Take your own bloody pants off.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"It's strange, isn't it? Almost everyone here's fought the Starks at one time or another. And here we are in their castle, ready to defend it. Together."
Episode 2,brienne,At least we'll die with honor.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I think we might live.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,I-I do. How many battles have we survived between us? Ser Davos Seaworth. Survivor of both the Blackwater and the Battle of the Bastards.
Episode 2,davos,All without a shred of combat ability.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Mm. Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Fabled loser of the Battle of Whispering Wood.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"Hear, hear! Ser Brienne of Tarth. Defeated the Hound in-Pardon me, Lady Brienne."
Episode 2,brienne,Women can't be knights.
Episode 2,brienne,Tradition.
Episode 2,brienne,I don't even want to be a knight.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,You don't need a king. Any knight can make another knight.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,I'll prove it.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"Kneel, Lady Brienne."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,Do you want to be a knight or not? Kneel.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"In the name of the Father, I charge you to be just."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"In the name of the Mother, I charge you to defend the innocent."
Episode 2,jaime lannister,"Arise, Brienne of Tarth a knight of the Seven Kingdoms."
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Ser Brienne of Tarth! Knight of the Seven Kingdoms!
Episode 2,jorah mormont,We have all we need to win this war.
Episode 2,jorah mormont,"Please, listen to me. You're the future of our house."
Episode 2,jorah mormont,You'll be safer in the crypt. These things we're fighting-
Episode 2,jorah mormont,"Thank you, my lady."
Episode 2,jorah mormont,What have you got there?
Episode 2,jorah mormont,You still have a family.
Episode 2,jorah mormont,I'll wield it in his memory to guard the realms of men.
Episode 2,jaime lannister,We'd better get some rest.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,"No, let's stay a bit longer."
Episode 2,davos,We're out of wine.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,How about a song? One of you must know one. Ser Davos?
Episode 2,davos,You'll pray for a quick death.
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Ser Brienne?
Episode 2,tyrion lannister,Mmm.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Who's that?
Episode 2,jon snow,Lyanna Stark.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"My brother, Rhaegar, everyone told me he was decent and kind. He liked to sing. Gave money to poor children. And he raped her."
Episode 2,jon snow,He didn't. He loved her.
Episode 2,jon snow,"They were married in secret. After Rhaegar fell on the Trident, she had a son. Robert would have murdered the baby if he ever found out, and Lyanna knew it. So the last thing she did, as she bled to death on her birthing bed, was give the boy to her brother, Ned Stark, to raise as his bastard."
Episode 2,jon snow,My name. My real name is Aegon Targaryen.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,That's impossible.
Episode 2,jon snow,I wish it were.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,Who told you this?
Episode 2,jon snow,Bran. He saw it.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,He saw it?
Episode 2,jon snow,And Samwell confirmed it. He read about their marriage at the Citadel without even knowing what it meant.
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,A secret no one in the world knew except your brother and your best friend. Doesn't seem strange to you?
Episode 2,jon snow,"It's true, Dany. I know it is."
Episode 2,daenerys targaryen,"If it were true, it would make you the last male heir of House Targaryen. You'd have a claim to the Iron Throne."
Episode 3,davos,Open the gate!
Episode 3,jon snow,The Night King is coming.
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,The dead are already here.
Episode 3,brienne,Stand your ground!
Episode 3,arya stark,Get down to the crypt.
Episode 3,sansa stark,I'm not abandoning my people.
Episode 3,arya stark,Take this and go.
Episode 3,sansa stark,I don't know how to use it.
Episode 3,arya stark,Stick them with the pointy end.
Episode 3,brienne,Fall back!
Episode 3,jon snow,Dany!
Episode 3,brienne,Hey! Hey! Hey!
Episode 3,brienne,Go! Hey! Go! Go!
Episode 3,jaime lannister,Get in! Get in! Get in! Come on!
Episode 3,jaime lannister,They're coming! Come on!
Episode 3,davos,She can't see us.
Episode 3,davos,Light the trenches!
Episode 3,varys,At least we're already in a crypt.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"If we were up there, we might see something everyone else is missing. Something that makes a difference."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,What? Remember the Battle of Blackwater? I brought us through the Mud Gate.
Episode 3,varys,And got your face cut in half.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,And it made a difference. If I was out there right now...
Episode 3,sansa stark,You'd die. There's nothing you can do.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,You might be surprised at the lengths I'd go to avoid joining the Army of the Dead. I could think of no organization less suited to my talents.
Episode 3,sansa stark,"Witty remarks won't make a difference. That's why we're down here, none of us can do anything. It's the truth. It's the most heroic thing we can do now look the truth in the face."
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Maybe we should have stayed married.
Episode 3,sansa stark,You were the best of them.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,What a terrifying thought.
Episode 3,sansa stark,It wouldn't work between us.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,Why not?
Episode 3,sansa stark,The Dragon Queen. Your divided loyalties would become a problem.
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,They lit the trench. Bran I just want you to know... I wish... The things I did
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,Go where?
Episode 3,davos,Man the walls!
Episode 3,jaime lannister,"Come on. Come on! Come on! Go, go, go!"
Episode 3,brienne,Come on!
Episode 3,jaime lannister,Get in there!
Episode 3,jaime lannister,Relieve the archers!
Episode 3,jaime lannister,Archers on top!
Episode 3,jorah mormont,Go! Go.
Episode 3,jaime lannister,Draw!
Episode 3,jaime lannister,Come on!
Episode 3,jaime lannister,Look out!
Episode 3,arya stark,I know you.
Episode 3,arya stark,You said we'd meet again.
Episode 3,arya stark,You said I'd shut many eyes forever. You were right about that too.
Episode 3,arya stark,Not today.
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,Here they come!
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,"Steady, lads."
Episode 3,theon greyjoy,Steady now. Make every shot count.
Episode 3,jon snow,Get off!
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Dracarys.
Episode 3,tyrion lannister,"Come on! Come on! No! No, no, no!"
Episode 3,jon snow,Bran!
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Go!
Episode 3,daenerys targaryen,Jorah!
Episode 3,jorah mormont,I'm hurt.
Episode 4,jon snow,We're here to say goodbye to our brothers and sisters. To our fathers and mothers. To our friends. Our fellow men and women who set aside their differences to fight together and die together so that others might live. Everyone in this world owes them a debt that can never be repaid. It is our duty and our honor to keep them alive in memory for those who come after us and those who come after them for as long as men draw breath. They were the shields that guarded the realms of men. And we shall never see their like again.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Gendry.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"That's right, isn't it?"
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,You're Robert Baratheon's son.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,You are aware he took my family's throne and tried to have me murdered?
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, he's dead. His brothers are too. So who's Lord of Storm's End now?"
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,Does anyone?
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,I think you should be Lord of Storm's End.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,"No, you are Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End, the lawful son of Robert Baratheon. Because that is what I have made you."
Episode 4,davos,To Lord Gendry Baratheon of Storm's End.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,A fitting reward for a hero.
Episode 4,sam,"Uh, hold on."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,And a Lord of Storm's End who will be forever loyal to you.
Episode 4,daenerys targaryen,See? You're not the only one who's clever.
Episode 4,jaime lannister,"We fought dead things and lived to talk about it. If this isn't the time to drink, when is?"
Episode 4,davos,"The last time I saw her, I told her I'd kill her if I ever saw her again."
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,I'm sure you had your reasons.
Episode 4,davos,I did. I do.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,So did you?
Episode 4,davos,"Never got the chance. She did it to herself. Or her god did it to her. Lord of Light. We play his game for him, we fight his war and win, and then he fucks off. No signs, no blessings. Who knows what he wants?"
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,I don't imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before.
Episode 4,davos,And what if I'm not trying to be happy?
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,"Then you're in luck. We may have defeated them, but we still have us to contend with."
Episode 4,davos,Thank you. I feel much better.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,This is clever. Even better than the saddle I designed for you.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,You know our history better than anyone. That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,You're the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,You don't want it.
Episode 4,tyrion lannister,I envy you.
Episode 5,varys,Come in.
Episode 5,varys,And?
Episode 5,varys,Nothing?
Episode 5,varys,We'll try again at supper.
Episode 5,varys,Who?
Episode 5,varys,Of course they are. That's their job.
Episode 5,varys,"What have I told you, Martha?"
Episode 5,varys,Go on. They'll be missing you in the kitchen.
Episode 5,varys,The Northern armies?
Episode 5,jon snow,Just crossed the Trident. They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days. How is she?
Episode 5,varys,"She hasn't seen anyone since we returned. Hasn't left her chambers, hasn't accepted any food."
Episode 5,jon snow,She shouldn't be alone.
Episode 5,varys,You're worried for her. I admire your empathy.
Episode 5,jon snow,Aren't you worried for her?
Episode 5,varys,"I'm worried for all of us. They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath."
Episode 5,jon snow,We're not much for riddles where I'm from.
Episode 5,varys,We both know what she's about to do.
Episode 5,jon snow,That's her decision to make. She is our queen.
Episode 5,varys,"Men decide where power resides, whether or not they know it."
Episode 5,jon snow,What do you want?
Episode 5,varys,All I've ever wanted. The right ruler on the Iron Throne. I still don't know how her coin has landed. But I'm quite certain about yours.
Episode 5,jon snow,I don't want it. I never have.
Episode 5,varys,"I have known more kings and queens than any man living. I've heard what they say to crowds, and seen what they do in the shadows. I have furthered their designs, however horrible. But what I tell you now is true"
Episode 5,jon snow,She is my queen.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Your Grace?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,There's something you need to know.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,Someone has betrayed me.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Yes.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,Jon Snow.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Varys.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,He knows the truth about Jon.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,He does.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"Because you told him. You learned from Sansa. And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her. As I said, he betrayed me."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,I'm glad Sansa told me. I am your Hand. I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,And Varys?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,You spoke to him first. Without coming to me. Without asking my permission.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,It was a mistake.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,Why do you think Sansa told you? What do you think she hoped to gain?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,She trusts me.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"Yes, she trusts you. She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen. And you did not let her down."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me. Our intentions were good. We wanted what you want. A better world, all of us. Varys as much as anyone."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,But it doesn't matter now.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,No. It doesn't matter now.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,It was me.
Episode 5,varys,"I hope I deserve this. Truly, I do. I hope I'm wrong. Goodbye, old friend."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"Lord Varys. I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons ..."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,sentence you to die. Dracarys.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,This was all she brought with her when we crossed the Narrow Sea. Her only possession.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"It's all right, Torgo Nudo. Let me speak with him."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,What did I say would happen if you told your sister?
Episode 5,jon snow,"I don't want it, and that's what I told him."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,She betrayed your trust. She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don't have love here. I only have fear.
Episode 5,jon snow,I love you. And you will always be my queen.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,Is that all I am to you? Your queen?
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"All right, then."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,Let it be fear.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"The people who live there, they're not your enemies. They're innocents, like the ones you liberated in Meereen."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,They're afraid. Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered. You can't expect them to be heroes. They're hostages.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,They are. In a tyrant's grip. Whose fault is that? Mine?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,What does it matter whose fault it is? Thousands of children will die if the city burns.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them. That's what she thinks our mercy is - weakness.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"I beg you, my queen-"
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,But she's wrong. Mercy is our strength. Our mercy towards future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,"Ready the Unsullied. Tonight you sail for King's Landing, to join the Northern armies."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"Cersei's followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost. Give them that chance. If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates. Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack."
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,Wait for me outside the city. You'll know when it's time.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines.
Episode 5,daenerys targaryen,It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all. The next time you fail me will be the last time you fail me.
Episode 5,davos,The rearguard should be here by daybreak.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,She wants to attack now.
Episode 5,jon snow,Daybreak at the earliest.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"Davos. I need to ask you a favor. You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you?"
Episode 5,davos,"I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?"
Episode 5,arya stark,I'm Arya Stark. I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,I drink to eat the skull keeper.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,I want to eat the skull keeper.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,I want to see the ...
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Ah. Good. I want to be alone with the prisoner. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be a long day.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Ordered by whom? The queen herself?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"Well, in that case, as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order. Probably by quite a lot."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,How did they find you?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Did you consider taking it off?
Episode 5,jaime lannister,"Cersei once called me ""the stupidest Lannister."""
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"And you're going back to her, to die with her."
Episode 5,jaime lannister,You've underestimated her before.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,She's going to die. Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Difficult to do from here.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"Try. If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise."
Episode 5,jaime lannister,"To be honest, I never really cared much for them. Innocent or otherwise."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,You do care for one innocent. I know you do. And so does Cersei. She has a reason now.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,"The child is the reason she'll never give an inch. All the worst things she's ever done, she's done for her children. It's not impossible that she'll win."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"She won't. Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be."
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Two of the three dragons are dead. She's evened the odds.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,The city will fall tomorrow.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,"She has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company-"
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,I defended the city last time it was attacked. I know it better than anyone. It will fall tomorrow.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,"Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Why?
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"Escape. The two of you, together. Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep? Take her down there. Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go. You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep. A dinghy will be waiting for you. Sail out of the bay. If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos. Start a new life."
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life? Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war-
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer. Do it. If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,Swear to me.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,You have my word.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates. That will be our signal that the city has surrendered."
Episode 5,jaime lannister,I'll try.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"I never thought I'd get to repay the favor. Remember, ring the bells and open the gates."
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Your queen will execute you for this.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible."
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"Tens of thousands of innocent lives one not particularly innocent dwarf it seems like a fair trade. If it weren't for you, I never wouldo ve survived my childhood."
Episode 5,jaime lannister,You would have.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,You were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster. You were all I had.
Episode 5,tyrion lannister,"If you hear the bells ring, they've surrendered. Call off your men."
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Soldier!
Episode 5,cersei lannister,All we need is one good shot.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,The Iron Fleet hold Blackwater Bay. Euron killed one of her dragons. He can kill another.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Our men will fight harder than sellswords ever could. They will defend their queen to the last man.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,The Red Keep has never fallen. It won't fall today.
Episode 5,jon snow,"Move, move!"
Episode 5,jon snow,No! Get back! Get back!
Episode 5,jon snow,Stay! Stay!
Episode 5,davos,Quickly. Quickly.
Episode 5,jon snow,Stop!
Episode 5,jon snow,Find somewhere to hide.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,We need to get the queen out of King's Landing.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,"Well, maybe for you."
Episode 5,jaime lannister,You're no king.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,The Red Keep is the safest place in the city.
Episode 5,arya stark,I'm going to kill her.
Episode 5,arya stark,Sandor.
Episode 5,arya stark,Thank you.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"Ser Gregor, stay by my side."
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"Ser Gregor, I command you."
Episode 5,cersei lannister,You're hurt.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,It doesn't matter.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,You're bleeding.
Episode 5,arya stark,Let go.
Episode 5,arya stark,Wait! Wait! No!
Episode 5,jon snow,We need to fall back! Fall back behind the wall! Fall back!
Episode 5,jon snow,Get out of the city! Fall back! Fall back! Fall back!
Episode 5,arya stark,You can't stay here. You have to keep moving.
Episode 5,arya stark,You have to.
Episode 5,arya stark,"If you stay here, you'll die. Follow me."
Episode 5,arya stark,Follow me!
Episode 5,arya stark,Get up. Get up!
Episode 5,arya stark,We have to keep moving.
Episode 5,arya stark,Come on! Come on!
Episode 5,jaime lannister,This way.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,I want our baby to live. I want our baby to live. I want our baby to live.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,"Don't let me die, Jaime. Please don't let me die."
Episode 5,jaime lannister,It's all right.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Please don't let me die.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,I don't want to die.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Just look- Look at me. Look at me.
Episode 5,cersei lannister,Not like this. Not like this. Not like this.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Look- Look- Look me in the eye. Don't look away. Don't look- Look at me! Just look at me.
Episode 5,jaime lannister,Nothing else matters. Nothing else matters. Only us.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,I'll find you later.
Episode 6,jon snow,It's not safe. Let me send some men with you.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,I'm going alone.
Episode 6,jon snow,Grey Worm!
Episode 6,jon snow,It's over.
Episode 6,davos,How much more defeated do you want them to be? They're on their knees.
Episode 6,davos,"Look around you, friend. We won."
Episode 6,jon snow,And what are the queen's commands?
Episode 6,davos,"Easy, men. Easy! Easy."
Episode 6,davos,Jon. We should speak with the queen.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,Blood of my blood.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,You kept all your promises to me. You killed my enemies in their iron suits.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,Your tore down their stone houses. You gave me the Seven Kingdoms.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,Torgo Nudho.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,"You have walked beside me since the Plaza of Pride. You are the bravest of men, the most loyal of soldiers. I name you commander of all my forces, the Queen's Master of War."
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,Unsullied. All of you were torn from your mother's arms and raised as slaves. Now you are liberators. You have freed the people of King's Landing from the grip of a tyrant!
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,But the war is not over. We will not lay down our spears until we have liberated all the people of the world!
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,"From Winterfell to Dorne, from Lannisport to Qarth, from the Summer Isles to the Jade Sea! Women, men and children have suffered too long beneath the wheel."
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,Will you break the wheel with me?
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,You freed your brother. You committed treason.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,I freed my brother. And you slaughtered a city.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,Take him.
Episode 6,jon snow,What are you doing here?
Episode 6,jon snow,"Hey, what happened?"
Episode 6,arya stark,I came to kill Cersei. Your queen got there first.
Episode 6,jon snow,She's everyone's queen now.
Episode 6,arya stark,Try telling Sansa.
Episode 6,jon snow,Wait for me outside the city gates. I'll come find you.
Episode 6,arya stark,Jon. She knows who you are. Who you really are. You'll always be a threat to her. And I know a killer when I see one.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Did you bring any wine?
Episode 6,jon snow,No.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Ah... Well... thank you for coming to see me. Our queen doesn't keep prisoners for long. I suppose there's a crude kind of justice. I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn. Now Varys's ashes can tell my ashes, ""See, I told you."" It just occurred to me. I'm talking to the only man alive who knows where I'm going."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,So is there life after death?
Episode 6,jon snow,Not that I've seen.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,I should be thankful. Oblivion is the best I could hope for. I strangled my lover. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I betrayed my queen.
Episode 6,jon snow,You didn't.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"I did. And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen. I chose my fate. The people of King's Landing did not."
Episode 6,jon snow,I can't justify what happened. I won't try. But the war is over now.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting?"
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She liberated the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.
Episode 6,jon snow,"And you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood.
Episode 6,jon snow,"You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day."
Episode 6,jon snow,Cersei left her no choice.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"The moment the gates fell, the battle was over."
Episode 6,jon snow,She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,And she burned down a city for it.
Episode 6,jon snow,"Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Would you have done it?
Episode 6,jon snow,What?
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"You've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down?"
Episode 6,jon snow,I don't know.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Yes, you do. You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know."
Episode 6,jon snow,What's it matter what I'd do?
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"It matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I'm sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?"
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother.
Episode 6,jon snow,Love is the death of duty.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,You just came up with that?
Episode 6,jon snow,Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?"
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,It's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?
Episode 6,jon snow,That's her decision. She is the queen.
Episode 6,jon snow,I'm sorry it came to this.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?
Episode 6,jon snow,My sisters will be loyal to the throne.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.
Episode 6,jon snow,She doesn't get to choose.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,No. But you do. And you have to choose now.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,"When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with a thousand swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do a thousand swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to twenty? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet."
Episode 6,jon snow,I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,It was necessary.
Episode 6,jon snow,"Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned!"
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,I tried to make peace with Cersei. She used their innocence as a weapon against me. She thought it would cripple me.
Episode 6,jon snow,And Tyrion?
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,"He conspired behind my back with my enemies. How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?"
Episode 6,jon snow,Forgive him.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,I can't.
Episode 6,jon snow,"You can. You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake. Make them understand."
Episode 6,jon snow,"Please, Dany."
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,We can't hide behind small mercies. The world we need won't be built by men loyal to the world we have.
Episode 6,jon snow,The world we need is a world of mercy. It has to be.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,And it will be. It's not easy to see something that's never been before. A good world.
Episode 6,jon snow,How do you know? How do you know it'll be good?
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,Because I know what is good. And so do you.
Episode 6,jon snow,I don't.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,You do. You do. You've always known.
Episode 6,jon snow,What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,They don't get to choose.
Episode 6,daenerys targaryen,"Be with me. Build the new world with me. This is our reason. It has been from the beginning, since you were a little boy with a bastardo s name and I was a little girl who couldn't count to twenty. We do it together. We break the wheel together."
Episode 6,jon snow,"You are my queen. Now, and always."
Episode 6,sansa stark,Where's Jon?
Episode 6,sansa stark,So is Lord Tyrion. They were both to be brought to this gathering.
Episode 6,sansa stark,"If you look outside the walls of your city, you'll find thousands of Northmen who will explain to you why harming Jon Snow is not in your interest."
Episode 6,sansa stark,You swore to follow a tyrant.
Episode 6,arya stark,Say another word about killing my brother and I'll cut your throat.
Episode 6,davos,"Friends, please. We've been cutting each other's throats long enough. Torgo Nudho. Am I saying that properly?"
Episode 6,davos,"If it weren't for you and your men, we wouldo ve lost the war with the dead. This country owes you a debt it can never repay, but let us try. There is land in the Reach. Good land. The people that used to live there are gone. Make it your own. Start your own house with the Unsullied as your bannermen. We've had enough war. Thousands of you, thousands of them. You know how it ends. We need to find a better way."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,It's not for you to decide.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,You're right. And no one's any better for it. But it's not for you to decide. Jon committed his crime here. His fate is for our king to decide. Or our queen.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,You're the most powerful people in Westeros. Choose one.
Episode 6,sansa stark,Uncle? Please sit.
Episode 6,sam,Why just us?
Episode 6,sam,"Um- We represent all the great houses, but whomever we choose, they won't just rule over lords and ladies. Maybe the decision about what's best for everyone should be left to well, everyone."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Me? The Imp?
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Can't think of a worse choice.
Episode 6,davos,"Who, then?"
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. About our bloody history. About the mistakes we've made.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. Our triumphs... mm, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future?"
Episode 6,sansa stark,Bran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Good. Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know. His will never torment us. That is the wheel our queen wanted to break."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"From now on, rulers will not be born. They will be chosen on this spot by the lords and ladies of Westeros to serve the realm."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"I know you don't want it. I know you don't care about power. But I ask you now, if we choose you will you wear the crown? Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms to the best of your abilities from this day until your last day?"
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,To Brandon of House Stark... I say aye.
Episode 6,sam,Aye.
Episode 6,davos,"I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye."
Episode 6,brienne,Aye.
Episode 6,sansa stark,"I love you, little brother. I always will. You'll be a good king. But tens of thousands of Northmen fell in the Great War defending all of Westeros. And those who survived have seen too much and fought too hard ever to kneel again. The North will remain an independent kingdom, as it was for thousands of years."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"All hail Bran the Broken, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"N- No, Your Grace, I don't want it."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"I don't deserve it. I thought I was wise, but I wasn't. I thought I knew what was right, but I didn't. Choose Ser Davos. Choose anyone else."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Giving you to the Unsullied would start a war. Letting you walk free would start a war. So our new king has chosen to send you to the Night's Watch.
Episode 6,jon snow,There's still a Night's Watch?
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,The world will always need a home for bastards and broken men.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"You shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. The Unsullied wanted your head of course, but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence. Sansa and Arya wanted you freed, but they understand our new king needs to make peace. No one is very happy. Which means it's a good compromise, I suppose."
Episode 6,jon snow,Was it right? What I did?
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,What we did.
Episode 6,jon snow,It doesn't feel right.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Ask me again in ten years.
Episode 6,jon snow,I don't expect we'll ever see each other again.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,I wouldn't be so sure. A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world.
Episode 6,sansa stark,I wish there had been another way. Can you forgive me?
Episode 6,jon snow,"The North is free, thanks to you."
Episode 6,sansa stark,But they lost their king.
Episode 6,jon snow,Ned Stark's daughter will speak for them. She's the best they could ask for.
Episode 6,jon snow,"You can come see me, you know, at Castle Black."
Episode 6,arya stark,I can't.
Episode 6,jon snow,You think anyone will dare tell you women aren't allowed?
Episode 6,arya stark,I'm not going back north.
Episode 6,sansa stark,Where are you going?
Episode 6,arya stark,What's west of Westeros?
Episode 6,arya stark,No one knows. It's where all the maps stop. That's where I'm going.
Episode 6,jon snow,You have your Needle?
Episode 6,arya stark,Right here.
Episode 6,jon snow,Your Grace.
Episode 6,jon snow,I'm sorry I wasn't there when you needed me.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,That's not- Uh-
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,What's this?
Episode 6,sam,A Song of Ice and Fire. Archmaester Ebrose's history of the wars following the death of King Robert. I helped him with the title.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,I suppose I come in for some heavy criticism.
Episode 6,sam,"Oh, I wouldn't say that."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Oh, he's kind to me. Never wouldo ve guessed."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,He's not kind?
Episode 6,sam,He-
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,He what? What does he say about me?
Episode 6,sam,"I don't believe you're mentioned, ahem."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Your Grace.
Episode 6,davos,Your Grace.
Episode 6,bronn,Your Grace.
Episode 6,sam,Your Grace.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Yes, Your Grace. Suitable prospects will be brought to you for an audience in the coming weeks."
Episode 6,sam,"He was last spotted flying east, toward-"
Episode 6,bronn,"The farther away, the better."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"As you wish, Your Grace."
Episode 6,brienne,Ser Podrick.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"We serve at your pleasure, King Bran the Broken, ruler of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. Long may he reign."
Episode 6,sam,Long may he reign.
Episode 6,davos,Long may he reign.
Episode 6,brienne,Long may he reign.
Episode 6,bronn,Long may he reign.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,That will improve.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of Coin, would you say the crown's debt to you has been paid?"
Episode 6,bronn,"In full, my lord Hand."
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Good. Time to start incurring a new one. We have hungry people to feed. Can we expect some assistance in this regard?
Episode 6,bronn,Indeed we can.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Lord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair."
Episode 6,davos,We have. These projects will begin as soon as the Master of Coin and Lord of Lofty Titles provides funding.
Episode 6,bronn,"The Master of Coin looks forward to helping the Master of Ships, but first he has to ensure we're not wasting coin, or soon there won't be no more coin."
Episode 6,davos,Any more.
Episode 6,bronn,You Master of Grammar now too?
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,"Grandmaester, ahem, it is my theory, based on my years of work on the Casterly Rock sewers, that clean water leads to a healthier population."
Episode 6,sam,The Archmaester has done some research on this subject and it turns out-
Episode 6,bronn,The strong live and the weak don't.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,Find the best builders and set them to the task.
Episode 6,bronn,"Oh, speaking of builders, all the best brothels burned down. The Master of Coin is willing to fund reconstruction."
Episode 6,sam,Uh... the Archmaester is less than enthusiastic about the salutary effects of brothels.
Episode 6,bronn,"Well, I imagine he isn't using them properly."
Episode 6,brienne,I think we can all agree that ships take precedence over brothels.
Episode 6,bronn,I think that's a very presumptuous statement.
Episode 6,tyrion lannister,I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel.
